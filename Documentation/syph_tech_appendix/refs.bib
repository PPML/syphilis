abstract = {The sexually transmitted bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all antibiotic classes that have been used for treatment and strains resistant to multiple antibiotic classes have evolved. In many countries, there is only one antibiotic remaining for empirical N. gonorrhoeae treatment, and antibiotic management to counteract resistance spread is urgently needed. Understanding dynamics and drivers of resistance spread can provide an improved rationale for antibiotic management. In our study, we first used antibiotic resistance surveillance data to estimate the rates at which antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread in two host populations, heterosexual men (HetM) and men who have sex with men (MSM). We found higher rates of spread for MSM (0.86 to 2.38 y-1, mean doubling time: 6 months) compared to HetM (0.24 to 0.86 y-1, mean doubling time: 16 months). We then developed a dynamic transmission model to reproduce the observed dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae transmission in populations of heterosexual men and women (HMW) and MSM. We parameterized the model using sexual behavior data and calibrated it to N. gonorrhoeae prevalence and incidence data. In the model, antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread with a median rate of 0.88 y-1 in HMW and 3.12 y-1 in MSM. These rates correspond to median doubling times of 9 (HMW) and 3 (MSM) months. Assuming no fitness costs, the model shows the difference in the host population's treatment rate rather than the difference in the number of sexual partners explains the differential spread of resistance. As higher treatment rates result in faster spread of antibiotic resistance, treatment recommendations for N. gonorrhoeae should carefully balance prevention of infection and avoidance of resistance spread.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection is empirical and based on population-wide susceptibilities. Increasing antimicrobial resistance underscores the potential importance of rapid diagnostic tests, including sequence-based tests, to guide therapy. However, the usefulness of sequence-based diagnostic tests depends on the prevalence and dynamics of the resistance mechanisms. METHODS We define the prevalence and dynamics of resistance markers to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones in 1102 resistant and susceptible clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected from 2000 to 2013 via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project. RESULTS Reduced extended-spectrum cephalosporin susceptibility is predominantly clonal and associated with the mosaic penA XXXIV allele and derivatives (sensitivity 98{\%} for cefixime and 91{\%} for ceftriaxone), but alternative resistance mechanisms have sporadically emerged. Reduced azithromycin susceptibility has arisen through multiple mechanisms and shows limited clonal spread; the basis for resistance in 36{\%} of isolates with reduced azithromycin susceptibility is unclear. Quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae has arisen multiple times, with extensive clonal spread. CONCLUSIONS Quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae and reduced cefixime susceptibility appear amenable to development of sequence-based diagnostic tests, whereas the undefined mechanisms of resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin underscore the importance of phenotypic surveillance. The identification of multidrug-resistant isolates highlights the need for additional measures to respond to the threat of untreatable gonorrhea.},

@article{Grey2016,
abstract = {Background: In the United States, male-to-male sexual transmission accounts for the greatest number of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses and a substantial number of sexually transmitted infections (STI) annually. However, the prevalence and annual incidence of HIV and other STIs among men who have sex with men (MSM) cannot be estimated in local contexts because demographic data on sexual behavior, particularly same-sex behavior, are not routinely collected by large-scale surveys that allow analysis at state, county, or finer levels, such as the US decennial census or the American Community Survey (ACS). Therefore, techniques for indirectly estimating population sizes of MSM are necessary to supply denominators for rates at various geographic levels. Objective: Our objectives were to indirectly estimate MSM population sizes at the county level to incorporate recent data estimates and to aggregate county-level estimates to states and core-based statistical areas (CBSAs). Methods: We used data from the ACS to calculate a weight for each county in the United States based on its relative proportion of households that were headed by a male who lived with a male partner, compared with the overall proportion among counties at the same level of urbanicity (ie, large central metropolitan county, large fringe metropolitan county, medium/small metropolitan county, or nonmetropolitan county). We then used this weight to adjust the urbanicity-stratified percentage of adult men who had sex with a man in the past year, according to estimates derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), for each county. We multiplied the weighted percentages by the number of adult men in each county to estimate its number of MSM, summing county-level estimates to create state- and CBSA-level estimates. Finally, we scaled our estimated MSM population sizes to a meta-analytic estimate of the percentage of US MSM in the past 5 years (3.9{\%}). Results: We found that the percentage of MSM among adult men ranged from 1.5{\%} (Wyoming) to 6.0{\%} (Rhode Island) among states. Over one-quarter of MSM in the United States resided in 1 of 13 counties. Among counties with over 300,000 residents, the five highest county-level percentages of MSM were San Francisco County, California at 18.5{\%} (66,586/359,566); New York County, New York at 13.8{\%} (87,556/635,847); Denver County, Colorado at 10.5{\%} (25,465/243,002); Multnomah County, Oregon at 9.9{\%} (28,949/292,450); and Suffolk County, Massachusetts at 9.1{\%} (26,338/289,634). Although California (n=792,750) and Los Angeles County (n=251,521) had the largest MSM populations of states and counties, respectively, the New York City-Newark-Jersey City CBSA had the most MSM of all CBSAs (n=397,399). Conclusions: We used a new method to generate small-area estimates of MSM populations, incorporating prior work, recent data, and urbanicity-specific parameters. We also used an imputation approach to estimate MSM in rural areas, where same-sex sexual behavior may be underreported. Our approach yielded estimates of MSM population sizes within states, counties, and metropolitan areas in the United States, which provide denominators for calculation of HIV and STI prevalence and incidence at those geographic levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gay and bisexual men are at elevated risk for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis (GC/CT). Rectal GC/CT symptoms may be less obvious than urethral, increasing opportunities for undiagnosed rectal GC/CT. METHODS A US national sample of 1071 gay and bisexual men completed urethral and rectal GC/CT testing and an online survey. RESULTS In total, 6.2{\%} were GC/CT positive (5.3{\%} rectal, 1.7{\%} urethral). We calculated adjusted (for education, race, age, relationship status, having health insurance, and income) odds ratios for factors associated with rectal and urethral GC/CT diagnoses. Age was inversely associated with urethral and rectal GC/CT. Compared with white men, Latinos had significantly greater odds of rectal GC/CT. Among men who reported anal sex, those reporting only insertive sex had lower odds of rectal GC/CT than did men who reported both insertive and receptive. There was a positive association between rectal GC/CT and number of male partners ({\textless}12 months), the number of anal receptive acts, receptive condomless anal sex (CAS) acts, and insertive CAS acts. Compared with those who had engaged in both insertive and receptive anal sex, those who engaged in only receptive anal sex had lower odds of urethral GC/CT. The number of male partners ({\textless}12 months) was associated with increased odds of urethral GC/CT. CONCLUSIONS Rectal GC/CT was more common than urethral and associated with some demographic and behavioral characteristics. Our finding that insertive CAS acts was associated with rectal GC/CT highlights that providers should screen patients for GC/CT via a full range of transmission routes, lest GC/CT go undiagnosed.},

@article{Kirkcaldy2016,
abstract = {PROBLEM/CONDITION Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States; 350,062 gonorrhea cases were reported in 2014. Sexually transmitted infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae are a cause of pelvic inflammatory disease in women, which can lead to serious reproductive complications including tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Prevention of sequelae and of transmission to sexual partners relies largely on prompt detection and effective antimicrobial treatment. However, treatment has been compromised by the absence of routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical care and evolution of antimicrobial resistance to the antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea. PERIOD COVERED 2014. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) was established in 1986 as a sentinel surveillance system to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States. Each month, N. gonorrhoeae isolates are collected from up to the first 25 men with gonococcal urethritis attending each of the participating sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics at 27 sites. The number of participating sites has varied over time (21-30 per year). Selected demographic and clinical data are abstracted from medical records. Isolates are tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using agar dilution at one of five regional laboratories. RESULTS A total of 5,093 isolates were collected in 2014. Of these, 25.3{\%} were resistant to tetracycline, 19.2{\%} to ciprofloxacin, and 16.2{\%} to penicillin (plasmid-based, chromosomal, or both). Reduced azithromycin susceptibility (Azi-RS) (defined as minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≥2.0 µg/mL) increased from 0.6{\%} in 2013 to 2.5{\%} in 2014. The increase occurred in all geographic regions, but was greatest in the Midwest, and among all categories of sex of sex partners (men who have sex with men [MSM], men who have sex with men and women [MSMW], and men who have sex with women [MSW]). No Azi-RS isolates exhibited reduced cefixime or ceftriaxone susceptibility (Cfx-RS and Cro-RS, respectively). The prevalence of Cfx-RS (MIC ≥0.25 µg/mL) increased from 0.1{\%} in 2006 to 1.4{\%} in both 2010 and 2011, decreased to 0.4{\%} in 2013, and increased to 0.8{\%} in 2014. Cro-RS (MIC ≥0.125 µg/mL) increased following a similar pattern but at lesser percentages (increased from 0.1{\%} in 2008 to 0.4{\%} in 2011 and decreased to 0.1{\%} in 2013 and 2014). The percentage of isolates resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, or all three antimicrobials, was greater in isolates from MSM than from MSW. INTERPRETATION This is the first report to present comprehensive surveillance data from GISP and summarize gonococcal susceptibility over time, as well as underscore the history and public health implications of emerging cephalosporin resistance. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns vary by geographic region within the United States and by sex of sex partner. Because dual therapy with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is the only recommended gonorrhea treatment, increases in azithromycin and cephalosporin MICs are cause for concern that resistance to these antimicrobial agents might be emerging. It is unclear whether increases in the percentage of isolates with Azi-RS mark the beginning of a trend. The percentage of isolates with elevated cefixime MICs increased during 2009-2010, then decreased during 2012-2013 after treatment recommendations were changed in 2010 to recommend dual therapy (with a cephalosporin and a second antibiotic) and a higher dosage of ceftriaxone. Subsequently, the treatment recommendations were changed again in 2012 to no longer recommend cefixime as part of first-line therapy (leaving ceftriaxone-based dual therapy as the only recommended therapy). Despite the MIC decrease (i.e., trend of improved cefixime susceptibility) during 2012-2013, the increase in the number of strains with Cfx-RS in 2014 underscores the potential threat of cephalosporin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria identifies prevention, rapid detection, and control of outbreaks of ceftriaxone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infection as a priority for U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance is conducted to guide development of treatment recommendations for effective therapy and prevention of complications from and transmission of gonorrhea. Federal agencies can use GISP data to develop national treatment recommendations and set research and prevention priorities. Local and state health departments can use GISP data to determine allocation of STD prevention services and resources, guide prevention planning, and communicate best treatment practices to health care providers. Continued surveillance, appropriate treatment, development of new antibiotics, and prevention of transmission remain the best strategies to reduce gonorrhea incidence and morbidity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND To date, research on men who have sex with men (MSM) has largely focused on their sexual health needs and on men recruited from gay-orientated venues. National probability survey data provide a rare opportunity to examine the broader sociodemographic, behavioural, and health profiles of MSM, defined as men who reported ≥1 male sexual partner(s) in the past 5 years, and thus regardless of their sexual identity, in comparison to men reporting sex exclusively with women (MSEW) during this time, and also the extent that health inequalities cluster. METHODS Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3), a probability sample survey, interviewed 15,162 people aged 16-74 years (6,293 men) during 2010-2012 using computer-assisted personal-interviewing with a computer-assisted self-interview. We used multivariable regression to compare MSM relative to MSEW in their reporting of variables, individually and collectively, corresponding to three domains: physical, mental, and sexual health. RESULTS Among all men, 2.6 {\%} (n = 190) were defined as MSM, of whom 52.5 {\%} (95 {\%} CI: 43.6 {\%}-61.2 {\%}) identified as gay. MSM were as likely as MSEW (n = 5,069) to perceive their health was 'bad'/'very bad', despite MSM being more likely to report a long-standing illness/disability/infirmity (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 1.46, 95 {\%} CI:1.02-2.09), treatment for depression/past year (2.75, 1.69-4.47), and substance use (e.g., recreational drug use/past year: 3.46, 2.22-5.40). MSM were more likely to report harmful sexual health behaviours, e.g., condomless sex with ≥2 partners/past year (3.52, 2.13-5.83), and poor sexual health outcomes, including STI diagnosis/es (5.67, 2.67-12.04), poorer sexual function (2.28, 1.57-3.33), both past year, and ever-experience of attempted non-volitional sex (6.51, 4.22-10.06). MSM were also more likely than MSEW to report poor health behaviours and outcomes both within and across the three health domains considered. Of all MSM, 8.4 {\%} had experienced poor health outcomes in all three domains - physical, mental, and sexual health - in contrast to 1.5 {\%} of all MSEW. CONCLUSIONS MSM are disproportionately affected by a broad range of harmful health behaviours and poor health outcomes. Although often observed for a minority of MSM, many health inequalities were seen in combination such that policies and practices aimed at improving the health and well-being of MSM require a holistic approach, regardless of clinical specialty.},

METHODS We developed a risk-structured deterministic compartmental mathematical model of syphilis transmission in a population of sexually active MSM. We assumed a baseline level of treatment of syphilis cases due to seeking medical care in all scenarios. We evaluated the impact of sustained annual population-wide screening coverage ranging from 0{\%} to 90{\%} on syphilis incidence over the short term (20 years) and at endemic equilibrium. RESULTS The relationship between screening coverage and equilibrium syphilis incidence displayed an inverted U-shape relationship, with peak equilibrium incidence occurring with 20-30{\%} annual screening coverage. Annual screening of 62{\%} of the population was required for local elimination (incidence {\textless}1 case per 100 000 population). Results were qualitatively similar in the face of differing programmatic, behavioural and natural history assumptions, although the screening thresholds for local elimination differed. With 6-monthly or 3-monthly screening, the population coverage required to achieve local elimination was reduced to 39{\%} or 23{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Although screening has the potential to control syphilis outbreaks, suboptimal coverage may paradoxically lead to a higher equilibrium infection incidence than that observed in the absence of intervention. Suboptimal screening programme design should be considered as a possible contributor to unsuccessful syphilis control programmes in the context of the current epidemic.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Increases in case numbers for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) have been noted on a global level. This study analysed 13 years of testing data to better understand case detection trends over time. METHODS: Data consisted of all nucleic acid probe and nucleic acid amplification diagnostic testing for CT and NG for the population of Manitoba, Canada (1.2 million); January 2000 to December 2012. Logistic regression models were used to analyse ORs associated with positive CT and NG tests by year. Included in the model as predictor variables were test type, specimen type, patient age and residence location. RESULTS: For both male and female CT results, unadjusted OR by year mimicked absolute case counts, reflecting a general increase over time in case counts. Adjustment for laboratory-related variables altered this relationship such that a general decline in the odds of identifying a CT case over time was evident. For both male and female NG results, adjustment for laboratory and demographic variables altered the OR associated with each year, but to a lesser extent than for CT. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal trends associated with CT case numbers should be interpreted after controlling, at a minimum, for the influence of laboratory-related variables. Interpretation of NG trends is feasible using only the number of reported NG cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) of the pharynx are common among men who have sex with men (MSM); the degree to which these infections are transmitted through oral sex is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of MSM attending Public Health-Seattle {\&} King County STD Clinic between 2001 and 2013 to estimate the proportion of symptomatic urethritis cases attributable to oral sex using two methods. First, we categorised men into the following mutually exclusive behavioural categories based on their self-reported sexual history in the previous 60 days: (1) only received oral sex (IOS); (2) 100{\%} condom usage with insertive anal sex plus oral sex (PIAI); (3) inconsistent condom usage with anal sex (UIAI); and (4) no sex. We then determined the proportion of cases in which men reported the oropharynx as their only urethral exposure (IOS and PIAI). Second, we calculated the population attributable risk per cent (PAR{\%}) associated with oral sex using Mantel-Haenszel OR estimates. RESULTS: Based on our behavioural categorisation method, men reported the oropharynx as their only urethral exposure in the past 60 days in 27.5{\%} of gonococcal urethritis, 31.4{\%} of chlamydial urethritis and 35.9{\%} non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial urethritis (NGNCU) cases. The PAR{\%}s for symptomatic gonococcal urethritis, chlamydial urethritis and NGNCU attributed to oropharyngeal exposure were 33.8{\%}, 2.7{\%} and 27.1{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pharynx is an important source of gonococcal transmission, and may be important in the transmission of chlamydia and other, unidentified pathogens that cause urethritis. Efforts to increase pharyngeal gonorrhoea screening among MSM could diminish STI transmission.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the United States have a high HIV incidence with substantial racial disparities that are poorly understood. We use a data-driven simulation model to understand the impact of network-level mechanisms and sexually transmitted infections on the spread of HIV among YMSM.METHODS:We designed and parameterized a stochastic agent-based network simulation model using results of a longitudinal cohort study of YMSM in Chicago. Within this model, YMSM formed and dissolved partnerships over time, and partnership types were stratified by length of partnership, sex, and age of the partner. In each partnership, HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia could be transmitted. Counterfactual scenarios were run to examine drivers of HIV.RESULTS:Over a 15-year simulation, the HIV epidemic among YMSM continued to rise, with Latino/white YMSM facing a steeper increase in the HIV burden compared with black YMSM. YMSM in partnerships with older MSM, in particular black YMSM with older black MSM, were at highest risk for HIV, and 1 infection prevented with an older partner would prevent 0.8 additional infections among YMSM. Additionally, racial disparities in HIV were driven by differences in the HIV prevalence of YMSM partners. Finally, of all HIV infections among YMSM, 14.6{\%} were attributable to NG and CT infections.CONCLUSION:Network-level mechanisms and sexually transmitted infections play a significant role in the spread of HIV and in racial disparities among YMSM. HIV prevention efforts should target YMSM across race, and interventions focusing on YMSM partnerships with older MSM might be highly effective.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between August and November 2014, the incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) rose dramatically in several districts of Sierra Leone. As a result, the number of cases exceeded the capacity of Ebola holding and treatment centres. During December, additional beds were introduced, and incidence declined in many areas. We aimed to measure patterns of transmission in different regions, and evaluate whether bed capacity is now sufficient to meet future demand. METHODS: We used a mathematical model of EVD infection to estimate how the extent of transmission in the nine worst affected districts of Sierra Leone changed between 10th August 2014 and 18th January 2015. Using the model, we forecast the number of cases that could occur until the end of March 2015, and compared bed requirements with expected future capacity. RESULTS: We found that the reproduction number, R, defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual, declined between August and December in all districts. We estimated that R was near the crucial control threshold value of 1 in December. We further estimated that bed capacity has lagged behind demand between August and December for most districts, but as a consequence of the decline in transmission, control measures caught up with the epidemic in early 2015. CONCLUSIONS: EVD incidence has exhibited substantial temporal and geographical variation in Sierra Leone, but our results suggest that the epidemic may have now peaked in Sierra Leone, and that current bed capacity appears to be sufficient to keep the epidemic under-control in most districts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence of unconfirmed positive gonorrhoea results when using molecular testing within a large population-based survey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2010 and 2012, we did a probability sample survey of 15,162 men and women aged 16-74 years in Britain. Urine from participants aged 16-44 years reporting {\textgreater}/=1 lifetime sexual partner was tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis using the Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) assay, with positive or equivocal results confirmed with molecular assays using different nucleic acid targets. RESULTS: A total of 4550 participants aged 16-44 years had urine test results (1885 men; 2665 women). For gonorrhoea, 18 samples initially tested positive and eight were equivocal. Only five out of 26 confirmed, giving a positive predictive value (PPV) for the initial testing of 19{\%} (95{\%} CI 4{\%} to 34{\%}). Most (86{\%} (18/21)) participants with unconfirmed positive results for gonorrhoea reported zero or one sexual partner without condoms in the past year and none had chlamydia co-infection, whereas all five with confirmed gonorrhoea reported at least two recent sexual partners without condoms, and four had chlamydia co-infection. The weighted prevalence for gonorrhoea positivity fell from 0.4{\%} (0.3{\%} to 0.7{\%}) after initial screening to {\textless}0.1{\%} (0.0{\%} to 0.1{\%}) after confirmatory testing. By comparison, 103 samples tested positive or equivocal for chlamydia and 98 were confirmed (PPV=95{\%} (91{\%} to 99{\%})). CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the low PPV for gonorrhoea of an unconfirmed reactive test when deploying molecular testing in a low-prevalence population. Failure to undertake confirmatory testing in low-prevalence settings may lead to inappropriate diagnoses, unnecessary treatment and overestimation of population prevalence.},

We tested a hypothesis that both individual-level risk factors (partner number, anal sex, condom use) and local-network features (concurrency and assortative mixing by race) combine to account for the association between race and chlamydia status. METHODS: Data from the Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health Wave III were used. Chlamydia status was determined using biomarkers. Individual-level risk behaviors were self-reported. Network location variables for concurrency and assortative mixing were imputed using egocentrically sample data on sexual partnerships. RESULTS: After controlling for demographic attributes including age, sex, marital status, education and health care access there remained a strong association between race and chlamydia status (OR = 5.23, 95{\%} CI [3.83-7.15], p {\textless} .001 for Non-Hispanic Blacks with Non-Hispanic Whites as the reference category). The inclusion of individual-level risk factors did not alter the association between race and chlamydia (OR = 5.23 for Non-Hispanic Blacks). The inclusion of concurrency and assortative mixing by race substantially reduced the association between race and chlamydia status (OR = 1.87, 95{\%} CI [0.89-3.91] p {\textgreater} .05 for Non-Hispanic Blacks).},

abstract = {Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) remains a serious burden in many high-sexual-activity, undertreated populations. Using empirical data from a 2009 study of GC burden among pastoralists in Kaokoveld, Namibia, we expand the standard gonorrhoea transmission model by using locally derived sexual contact data to explore transmission dynamics in a population with high rates of partner exchange and low treatment-seeking behaviour. We use the model to generate ball-park estimates for transmission probabilities and other parameter values for low-level (i.e. less than approx. 1200 copies/20 µl PCR reaction) asymptomatic infections, which account for 74{\%} of all GC infections found in Kaokoveld in 2009, and to describe the impact of asymptomatic, low-level infections on overall prevalence patterns. Our results suggest that GC transmission probabilities are higher than previously estimated, that untreated infections take longer to clear than previously estimated and that a high prevalence of low-level infections is partially due to larger numbers of untreated, asymptomatic infections. These results provide new insights into the natural history of GC and the challenge of syndromic management programmes for the eradication of endemic gonorrhoea.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many individuals, the implementation of the US Affordable Care Act will involve a transition from public to private health care venues for sexually transmitted infection (STI) care and prevention. To anticipate challenges primary care providers may face and to inform the future role of publicly funded STI clinics, it is useful to consider their current functions. METHODS: Data collected by 40 STI clinics that are a part of the Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Network were used to describe patient demographic and behavioral characteristics, STI diagnoses, and laboratory testing data in 2010 and 2011. RESULTS: A total of 608,536 clinic visits were made by 363,607 unique patients. Most patients (61.9{\%}) were male; 21.9{\%} of men reported sex with men (MSM). Roughly half of patients were 20 to 29 years old (47.1{\%}) and non-Hispanic black (56.2{\%}). There were 212,765 STI diagnoses (mostly nonreportable) that required clinical examinations. A high volume of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV testing was performed ({\textgreater}350,000 tests); the prevalence was 11.5{\%} for chlamydia, 5.8{\%} for gonorrhea, 0.9{\%} for HIV, and varied greatly by sex and MSM status. Among MSM with chlamydia or gonorrhea, 40.1{\%} (1811/4448) of chlamydial and 46.2{\%} (3370/7300) of gonococcal infections were detected at extragenital sites. CONCLUSIONS: Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Network clinics served populations with high STI rates. Given experience with diagnoses of both nonreportable and reportable STIs and extragenital chlamydia and gonorrhea testing, STI clinics comprise a critical specialty network in STI diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.},

@article{Xiridou2015,
abstract = {Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. The control of gonorrhoea is extremely challenging because of the repeated development of resistance to the antibiotics used for its treatment. We explored different strategies to control the spread of antimicrobial resistance and prevent increases in gonorrhoea prevalence. We used a mathematical model that describes gonorrhoea transmission among men who have sex with men and distinguishes gonorrhoea strains sensitive or resistant to three antibiotics. We investigated the impact of combination therapy, switching first-line antibiotics according to resistance thresholds, and other control efforts (reduced sexual risk behaviour, increased treatment rate). Combination therapy can delay the spread of resistance better than using the 5{\%} resistance threshold. Increased treatment rates, expected to enhance gonorrhoea control, may reduce gonorrhoea prevalence only in the short term, but could lead to more resistance and higher prevalence in the long term. Re-treatment of resistant cases with alternative antibiotics can substantially delay the spread of resistance. In conclusion, combination therapy and re-treatment of resistant cases with alternative antibiotics could be the most effective strategies to prevent increases in gonorrhoea prevalence due to antimicrobial resistance.},

@article{Golden2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: US gonorrhea treatment guidelines recently changed to promote ceftriaxone as first-line therapy. Because ceftriaxone requires intramuscular administration, this could lead some patients to go untreated. METHODS: We used an arithmetic model to compare the number of persons with gonorrhea who would be successfully treated with continued use of oral therapies versus exclusive use of ceftriaxone. Our base case scenario assumed the following: decreased cefixime susceptibility in 2{\%} of heterosexuals and 5{\%} of men who have sex with men, baseline oral therapy in 30{\%} of heterosexuals and 15{\%} of men who have sex with men, oral treatment failure in 10{\%} of decreased susceptibility cases, and baseline patient-delivered partner therapy use in 30{\%} of heterosexuals. RESULTS: Considering only effects on index cases, universal ceftriaxone use would result in fewer cures if at least 5{\%} of oral therapy recipients go untreated with the change in treatment practice. Exclusive ceftriaxone use consistently led to fewer infected persons being cured when the model incorporated partner treatment effects and assumed that the change in treatment practices eliminated the use of patient delivered partner therapy. If oral treatment were 75{\%} effective against decreased susceptibility gonorrhea, exclusive ceftriaxone use would likely increase cure rates in persons with decreased susceptibility gonorrhea, but could diminish them in persons with gonorrhea overall. CONCLUSIONS: At least in the short term, eliminating oral therapy for gonorrhea will likely have small effects on decreased susceptibility treatment failures and could increase gonorrhea rates overall.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia (CT) are the most commonly reported notifiable diseases in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that men who have sex with men (MSM) be screened for urogenital GC/CT, rectal GC/CT, and pharyngeal GC. We describe extragenital GC/CT testing and infections among MSM attending sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. METHODS: The STD Surveillance Network collects patient data from 42 STD clinics. We assessed the proportion of MSM attending these clinics during July 2011-June 2012 who were tested and positive for extragenital GC/CT at their most recent visit or in the preceding 12 months and the number of extragenital infections that would have remained undetected with urethral screening alone. RESULTS: Of 21 994 MSM, 83.9{\%} were tested for urogenital GC, 65.9{\%} for pharyngeal GC, 50.4{\%} for rectal GC, 81.4{\%} for urogenital CT, 31.7{\%} for pharyngeal CT, and 45.9{\%} for rectal CT. Of MSM tested, 11.1{\%} tested positive for urogenital GC, 7.9{\%} for pharyngeal GC, 10.2{\%} for rectal GC, 8.4{\%} for urogenital CT, 2.9{\%} for pharyngeal CT, and 14.1{\%} for rectal CT. More than 70{\%} of extragenital GC infections and 85{\%} of extragenital CT infections were associated with negative urethral tests at the same visit and would not have been detected with urethral screening alone. CONCLUSIONS: Extragenital GC/CT was common among MSM attending STD clinics, but many MSM were not tested. Most extragenital infections would not have been identified, and likely would have remained untreated, with urethral screening alone. Efforts are needed to facilitate implementation of extragenital GC/CT screening recommendations for MSM.},

abstract = {Components in 4CMenB vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B have shown to potentially cross-react with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We modeled the theoretical impact of a US 4CMenB vaccination program on gonorrhea outcomes. A decision-analysis model was populated using published healthcare utilization and cost data. A two-dose adolescent vaccination campaign was assumed, with protective immunity starting at age 15 years and a base-case efficacy against gonorrhea of 20{\%}. The 20{\%}-efficacy level is an assumption since no clinical data have yet quantified the efficacy of 4CMenB against Neisseria gonorrhoea. Key outcome measures were reductions in gonorrhea and HIV infections, reduction in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost, and the economically justifiable price assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of {\$}75,000 per QALY gained. Adolescent vaccination with 4CMenB would prevent 83,167 (95{\%} credible interval [CrI], 44,600-134,600) gonorrhea infections and decrease the number of HIV infections by 55 (95{\%} CrI, 2-129) per vaccinated birth cohort in the USA. Excluding vaccination costs, direct medical costs for gonorrhea would reduce by {\$}28.7 million (95{\%} CrI, {\$}6.8-{\$}70.0 million), and income and productivity losses would reduce by {\$}40.0 million (95{\%} CrI, {\$}8.2-{\$}91.7 million). Approximately 83{\%} of the reduction in lost productivity is generated by avoiding HIV infections. At a cost of {\$}75,000 per QALY gained, and incremental to the vaccine's effect on meningococcal disease, a price of {\$}26.10 (95{\%} CrI, {\$}9.10-{\$}57.20) per dose, incremental to the price of the meningococcal vaccine, would be justified from the societal perspective. At this price, the net cost per infection averted would be {\$}1,677 (95{\%} CrI, {\$}404-{\$}2,564). Even if the cross-immunity of 4CMenB vaccine and gonorrhea is only 20{\%}, the reduction in gonorrhea infections and associated costs would be substantial.},

Increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to cefixime have been identified worldwide and have been associated with reports of clinical failure.OBJECTIVE:To assess the risk of clinical treatment failure of N. gonorrhoeae infections associated with the use of cefixime.DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION:A retrospective cohort study of culture-positive N. gonorrhoeae infections at a single sexual health clinic in Toronto, Canada, that routinely performs test of cure. The cohort comprised N. gonorrhoeae culture-positive individuals identified between May 1, 2010, and April 30, 2011, treated with cefixime as recommended by Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Cefixime treatment failure, defined as the repeat isolation of N. gonorrhoeae at the test-of-cure visit identical to the pretreatment isolate by molecular typing and explicit denial of reexposure.RESULTS:There were 291 N. gonorrhoeae culture-positive individuals identified. Of 133 who returned for test of cure, 13 were culture positive; 9 patients were determined to have experienced cefixime treatment failure, involving urethral (n = 4), pharyngeal (n = 2), and rectal (n = 3) sites. The overall rate of clinical treatment failure among those who had a test of cure was 6.77{\%} (95{\%} CI, 3.14{\%}-12.45{\%}; 9/133). The rate of clinical failure associated with a cefixime MIC of 0.12 $\mu$g/mL or greater was 25.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 10.69{\%}-44.87{\%}; 7/28) compared with 1.90{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.23{\%}-6.71{\%}; 2/105) of infections with cefixime MICs less than 0.12 $\mu$g/mL, with a relative risk of 13.13 (95{\%} CI, 2.88-59.72; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The rate of clinical failure following treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections with cefixime was relatively high at a Toronto clinic and was associated with elevated MICs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) who have a current or recent history of rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infection are at greater risk for HIV than MSM with no history of rectal infection. Screening and treating MSM for rectal CT/GC infection may help reduce any increased biological susceptibility to HIV infection. METHODS: We used 2 versions of a Markov state-transition model to examine the impact and cost-effectiveness of screening MSM for rectal CT/GC infection in San Francisco: a static version that included only the benefits to those screened and a dynamic version that accounted for population-level impacts of screening. HIV prevention through reduced susceptibility to HIV was the only potential benefit of rectal CT/GC screening that we included in our analysis. Parameter values were based on San Francisco program data and the literature. RESULTS: In the base case, the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained through screening MSM for rectal CT/GC infection was {\$}16,300 in the static version of the model. In the dynamic model, the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was less than {\$}0, meaning that rectal screening was cost-saving. The impact of rectal CT/GC infection on the risk of HIV acquisition was the most influential model parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Although more information is needed regarding the impact of rectal CT/GC screening on HIV incidence, rectal CT/GC screening of MSM can potentially be a cost-effective, scalable intervention targeted to at-risk MSM in certain urban settings such as San Francisco.},

abstract = {Background For almost two decades, chlamydia and gonorrhoea diagnosis rates in remote Indigenous communities have been up to 30 times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians. The high levels of population movement known to occur between remote communities may contribute to these high rates. Methods We developed an individual-based computer simulation model to study the relationship between population movement and the persistence of gonorrhoea and chlamydia transmission within hypothetical remote communities. Results Results from our model suggest that short-term population movement can facilitate gonorrhoea and chlamydia persistence in small populations. By fixing the number of short-term travellers in accordance with census data, we found that these STIs can persist if at least 20{\%} of individuals in the population seek additional partners while away from home and if the time away from home is less than 21?days. Periodic variations in travel patterns can contribute to increased sustainable levels of infection. Expanding existing STI testing and treatment programs to cater for short-term travellers is shown to be ineffective due to their short duration of stay. Testing and treatment strategies tailored to movement patterns, such as encouraging travellers to seek testing and treatment upon return from travel, will likely be more effective. Conclusion High population mobility is likely to contribute to the high levels of STIs observed in remote Indigenous communities of Australia. More detailed data on mobility patterns and sexual behaviour of travellers will be invaluable for designing and assessing STI control programs in highly mobile communities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gonorrhea treatment has been complicated by antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonococcal fluoroquinolone resistance emerged more rapidly among men who have sex with men (MSM) than men who have sex exclusively with women (MSW). OBJECTIVE To determine whether N. gonorrhoeae urethral isolates from MSM were more likely than isolates from MSW to exhibit resistance to or elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials used to treat gonorrhea. DESIGN 6 years of surveillance data from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project. SETTING Publicly funded sexually transmitted disease clinics in 30 U.S. cities. PATIENTS Men with a total of 34 600 episodes of symptomatic urethral gonorrhea. MEASUREMENTS Percentage of isolates exhibiting resistance or elevated MICs and adjusted odds ratios for resistance or elevated MICs among isolates from MSM compared with isolates from MSW. RESULTS In all U.S. regions except the West, isolates from MSM were significantly more likely to exhibit elevated MICs of ceftriaxone and azithromycin than isolates from MSW (P {\textless} 0.050). Isolates from MSM had a high prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline and were significantly more likely to exhibit antimicrobial resistance than isolates from MSW (P {\textless} 0.001). LIMITATIONS Sentinel surveillance may not be representative of all patients with gonorrhea. HIV status, travel history, and antimicrobial use data were missing for some patients. CONCLUSION Men who have sex with men are vulnerable to the emerging threat of antimicrobial-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. Because antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not routinely done in clinical practice, clinicians should monitor for treatment failures among MSM diagnosed with gonorrhea. Strengthened prevention strategies for MSM and new antimicrobial treatment options are needed.},

abstract = {The fitness cost of antibiotic resistance in the absence of treatment raises the possibility that prudent use of drugs may slow or reverse the rise of resistance. Unfortunately, compensatory mutations that lower this cost may lead to entrenched resistance. Here, we develop a mathematical model of resistance evolution and compensatory mutation to determine whether reversion to sensitivity can occur, and how disease control might be facilitated by a second-line therapy. When only a single antibiotic is available, sensitive bacteria reach fixation only under treatment rates so low that hardly any cases are treated. We model a scenario in which drug sensitivity can be accurately tested so that a second-line therapy is administered to resistant cases. Before the rise of resistance to the second drug, disease eradication is possible if resistance testing and second-line treatment are conducted at a high enough rate. However, if double drug resistance arises, the possibility of disease eradication is greatly reduced and compensated resistance prevails in most of the parameter space. The boundary separating eradication from fixation of compensated resistance is strongly influenced by the underlying basic reproductive number of the pathogen and drug efficacy in sensitive cases, but depends less on the resistance cost and compensation. When double resistance is possible, the boundary is affected by the relative strengths of resistance against the two drugs in the double-resistant-compensated strain.},

abstract = {Background: Most sexually active people will be infected with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) at some point in their lives. The number of STIs in the United States was previously estimated in 2000. We updated previous estimates to reflect the number of STIs for calendar year 2008. Methods: We reviewed available data and literature and conservatively estimated incident and prevalent infections nationally for 8 common STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, HIV, and trichomoniasis. Where available, data from nationally representative surveys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to provide national estimates of STI prevalence or incidence. The strength of each estimate was rated good, fair, or poor, according to the quality of the evidence. Results: In 2008, there were an estimated 110 million prevalent STIs among women and men in the United States. Of these, more than 20{\%} of infections (22.1 million) were among women and men aged 15 to 24 years. Approximately 19.7 million incident infections occurred in the United States in 2008 nearly 50{\%} (9.8 million) were acquired by young women and men aged 15 to 24 years. Human papillomavirus infections, many of which are asymptomatic and do not cause disease, accounted for most of both prevalent and incident infections. Conclusions: Sexually transmitted infections are common in the United States, with a disproportionate burden among young adolescents and adults. Public health efforts to address STIs should focus on prevention among at-risk populations to reduce the number and impact of STIs. DOI: 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e318286bb53},

However, this study finds that finds that bistability may not be an option at all; the disease-free equilibrium could be globally stable when there is a backward bifurcation. Furthermore, when a backward bifurcation occurs, the fashion of bistability could be the coexistence of either dual stable equilibria or the disease-free equilibrium and a stable limit cycle. We also extend the formula for mean infection period from density-independent treatments to density-dependent ones. Finally, the modeling results are applied to the transmission of gonorrhea in China, suggesting that these gonorrhea patients may not seek medical treatments in a timely manner.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genital tract infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae are a major cause of sexually transmitted disease worldwide. Surveillance data suggest that incidence has increased in recent years after initially falling in the face of intensified control efforts. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to evaluate the potential contribution of antimicrobial resistance to such rebound and to identify optimal treatment strategies in the face of resistance using a mathematical model of gonorrhoea. METHODS: The authors built risk-structured 'susceptible-infectious-susceptible' models with and without the possibility of antibiotic resistance and used these models as a platform for the evaluation of competing plausible treatment strategies, including changing antimicrobial choice when resistance prevalence surpassed fixed thresholds, random assignment of treatment and use of combination antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Absent antimicrobial resistance, strategies that focus on treatment of highest risk individuals (the so-called core group) result in collapse of disease transmission. When antimicrobial resistance exists, a focus on the core group causes rebound in incidence, with maximal dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Random assignment of antimicrobial treatment class outperformed the use of fixed resistance thresholds with respect to sustained reduction in gonorrhoea prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Gonorrhoea control is achievable only when core groups are treated, but treatment of core groups maximises dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant strains. This paradox poses a great dilemma to the control and prevention of gonorrhoea and underlines the need for gonococcal vaccines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although a potentially important route for transmission, limited data exist on the burden of pharyngeal chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (GC) among men who have sex with men (MSM). We examined pharyngeal CT and GC among MSM screened in San Francisco in 2010. METHODS: MSM seeking services in a variety of clinical settings provided clinician-collected pharyngeal specimens that were tested using the APTIMA Combo 2 platform. The prevalence of pharyngeal CT and GC was estimated at 5 sentinel sites: the municipal STD clinic, a gay men's health clinic, an HIV care clinic, an HIV testing site, and primary care clinics supported by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Positivity for each infection was calculated as the number of positive tests divided by the number of testers with corresponding confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In 2010, a total of 12,454 pharyngeal CT specimens and 12,457 pharyngeal GC specimens were tested for an overall CT positivity of 1.69{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.47-1.93) and GC positivity of 5.76{\%} (95{\%} CI: 5.36-6.19). At the 5 sentinel sites, pharyngeal CT positivity ranged from 1.10{\%} (HIV testing site) to 2.28{\%} (STD clinic); pharyngeal GC positivity ranged from 3.4{\%} (HIV testing site) to 7.01{\%} (STD clinic). CONCLUSION: Sentinel surveillance data indicate that there is a substantial burden of pharyngeal CT and GC infections among MSM in San Francisco. Identification and treatment of pharyngeal infections could prevent ongoing transmission of these bacteria. Increasing access to nucleic acid amplification tests-based pharyngeal screening should be a public health priority.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study determined prevalence of asymptomatic nonurethral gonorrhea and chlamydia in men who have sex with men (MSM) seen at the Columbia University Health Service for routine care. PARTICIPANTS: The study enrolled 200 participants from March 2007 to May 2010. RESULTS: Specimens were tested using culture and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT): 3.5{\%} (n = 7) tested positive for pharyngeal gonorrhea by NAAT, none were positive by culture; 3{\%} (n = 6) tested positive for rectal chlamydia by NAAT and 0.5{\%} (n = 1) by culture. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pharyngeal gonorrhea and rectal chlamydia in MSM who visited the Columbia Health Service was similar to rates of asymptomatic nonurethral gonorrhea and chlamydia in studies conducted in the MSM population in non-university settings. This suggests that, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, 3-site testing for MSM seen at the Columbia clinic is indicated. NAAT is more sensitive than culture for nonurethral gonorrhea and chlamydia.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Most mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) assume that infected individuals become susceptible to re-infection immediately after recovery. This paper assesses whether extending the standard model to allow for temporary immunity after recovery improves the correspondence between observed and modelled levels of STI prevalence in South Africa, for gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis. Five different models of immunity and symptom resolution were defined, and each model fitted to South African STI prevalence data. The models were compared in terms of Bayes factors, which show that in the case of gonorrhoea and chlamydial infection, models that allow for immunity provide a significantly better fit to STI prevalence data than models that do not allow for immunity. For all three STIs, estimates of the impact of changes in STI treatment and sexual behaviour are significantly lower in models that allow for immunity. Mathematical models that do not allow for immunity could therefore overestimate the effectiveness of STI interventions.},

Given the ancient nature of and its unique obligate relationship with humankind over the millennia, its remarkable ability to adapt to the host immune system and cause repeated infections, and its propensity to develop resistance to all clinically useful antibiotics, the gonococcus is an ideal pathogen on which to study the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis, including antimicrobial resistance, over the long term and within the host during infection. Recently, the first gonococcus displaying high‐level resistance to ceftriaxone, identified in Japan, was characterized in detail. Ceftriaxone is the last remaining option for empirical first‐line treatment, and now seems to be evolving into a true “superbug.” In the near future, gonorrhea may become untreatable in certain circumstances. Herein, the history of antibiotics used for treatment of gonorrhea, the evolution of resistance emergence in , the linkage between resistance and biological fitness of , lessons learned, and future perspectives are reviewed and discussed.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: HIV infection continues to disproportionately affect men who have sex with men (MSM). Identification of modifiable risk factors for HIV infection among MSM is critical for effective prevention. METHODS: We examined the relationship between number of prior rectal Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) or Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections and HIV seroconversion in a retrospective cohort of HIV-uninfected MSM diagnosed with a rectal infection. Number of rectal CT or GC infections in the prior 2 years was the primary exposure. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between prior rectal infections and HIV seroconversion. RESULTS: A total of 541 MSM were observed for a total of 1197.96 person-years. Overall, 27 (4.99{\%}) of the MSM became infected with HIV, for an estimated annual incidence of 2.25{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.49 to 3.26]. In multivariate analysis, an early syphilis diagnosis in the past 2 years (hazard ratio = 4.04, 95{\%} CI: 1.19 to 13.79) and 2 prior CT or GC rectal infections in the past 2 years (hazard ratio = 8.85, 95{\%} CI: 2.57 to 30.40) were associated with incident HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Among MSM infected with rectal GC or CT, a history of 2 additional prior rectal infections was associated with an 8-fold increased risk of HIV infection. HIV-uninfected MSM with multiple rectal infections represent a population in need of innovative HIV-prevention interventions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antiretroviral treatment means that an increasing number of men who have sex with men (MSM) are living with HIV. The present review focuses on continuing transmission of HIV, risk factors for HIV infection in HIV-negative MSM, risk behaviour and risk reduction interventions among HIV-positive MSM, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and ageing and new and emerging populations of MSM communities. RECENT FINDINGS: Transmission of HIV infection continues in populations of MSM; transmission may be particularly high from main partners. Serosorting offers limited protection against HIV infection for HIV-negative MSM; negotiated safety and strategic positioning may be partially protective. For HIV-positive men, serosorting is a strategy to prevent HIV transmission, but has contributed to high rates of new non-HIV sexually transmitted infections. Sexual networks are important to the understanding of emerging sexually transmitted infections; ageing brings a new dimension to research on HIV. SUMMARY: Strategies other than exclusive condom use have emerged in communities of MSM to reduce the risk of HIV transmission, including serosorting and strategic positioning. 'Combination prevention' - using social structural, behavioural and biomedical approaches in tandem - could reduce the risk of HIV transmission, and may be particularly suited to HIV-positive MSM.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To propose a Bayesian approach to uncertainty analysis of sexually transmitted infection (STI) models, which can be used to quantify uncertainty in model assessments of policy options, estimate regional STI prevalence from sentinel surveillance data and make inferences about STI transmission and natural history parameters. METHODS: Prior distributions are specified to represent uncertainty regarding STI parameters. A likelihood function is defined using a hierarchical approach that takes account of variation between study populations, variation in diagnostic accuracy as well as random binomial variation. The method is illustrated using a model of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis in South Africa. RESULTS: Model estimates of STI prevalence are in good agreement with observations. Out-of-sample projections and cross-validations also show that the model is reasonably well calibrated. Model predictions of the impact of interventions are subject to significant uncertainty: the predicted reductions in the prevalence of syphilis by 2020, as a result of doubling the rate of health seeking, increasing the proportion of private practitioners using syndromic management protocols and screening all pregnant women for syphilis, are 43{\%} (95{\%} CI 3{\%} to 77{\%}), 9{\%} (95{\%} CI 1{\%} to 19{\%}) and 6{\%} (95{\%} CI 4{\%} to 7{\%}), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends uncertainty analysis techniques for fitted HIV/AIDS models to models that are fitted to other STI prevalence data. There is significant uncertainty regarding the relative effectiveness of different STI control strategies. The proposed technique is reasonable for estimating uncertainty in past STI prevalence levels and for projections of future STI prevalence.},

abstract = {The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has decided to use Bayesian melding as the basis for its probabilistic projections of HIV prevalence in countries with generalized epidemics. This combines a mechanistic epidemiological model, prevalence data, and expert opinion. Initially, the posterior distribution was approximated by sampling-importance-resampling, which is simple to implement, easy to interpret, transparent to users, and gave acceptable results for most countries. For some countries, however, this is not computationally efficient because the posterior distribution tends to be concentrated around nonlinear ridges and can also be multimodal. We propose instead incremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS), which iteratively builds up a better importance sampling function. This retains the simplicity and transparency of sampling importance resampling, but is much more efficient computationally. It also leads to a simple estimator of the integrated likelihood that is the basis for Bayesian model comparison and model averaging. In simulation experiments and on real data, it outperformed both sampling importance resampling and three publicly available generic Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for this kind of problem.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial/ethnic minorities and men who have sex with men (MSM) represent populations with disparate sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates. While race-specific STI rates have been widely reported, STI rates among MSM is often challenging given the absence of MSM population estimates. We evaluated the race-specific rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea among MSM and non-MSM in San Francisco between 1999-2008. METHODS: 2000 US Census data for San Francisco was used to estimate the number of African-American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and white males. Data from National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) MSM 1, conducted in 2004, was used to estimate the total number of MSM in San Francisco and the size of race/ethnic sub-populations of MSM. Non-MSM estimates were calculated by subtracting the number of estimated MSM from the total number of males residing in San Francisco. Rates of MSM and non-MSM gonorrhea and chlamydia reported between 1999 and 2008 were stratified by race/ethnicity. Ratios of MSM and non-MSM rates of morbidity were calculated by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Between 1999-2008, MSM accounted for 72{\%} of gonorrhea cases and 51{\%} of chlamydia cases. Throughout the study period, African-American MSM had the highest chlamydia rate with 606 cases per 100,000 in 1999 increasing to 2067 cases per 100,000 in 2008. Asian/Pacific Islander MSM consistently had the lowest rate among MSM with 1003 cases per 100,000 in 2008. The ratio of MSM/non-MSM for chlamydia was highest among whites 11.6 (95{\%} CI: 8.8-14.4) and Asian/Pacific Islanders 8.6 (95{\%} CI: 6.2-11), and lowest among African-Americans 1.53 (95{\%} CI: 1.2-1.9) and Hispanics 4.43 (95{\%} CI: 2.8-6.0). Gonorrhea rates were similar for African-American, white, and Hispanic MSM between 2137-2441 cases per 100,000 in 2008. Asian/Pacific Islander MSM had the lowest gonorrhea rate with 865 cases per 100,000 in 2008. The ratio of MSM/non-MSM for gonorrhea was highest among whites 11.6 (95{\%} CI: 8.8-14.4) and Asian/Pacific Islanders 8.6 (95{\%} CI: 6.2-11), and lowest among African-Americans 1.53 (95{\%} CI: 1.2-1.9) and Hispanics 4.43 (95{\%} CI: 2.8-6.0). CONCLUSIONS: For all racial/ethnic groups in San Francisco, MSM carried a substantially higher burden of STIs compared to non-MSM except among African-American men. These racial and sexual behavior disparities warrant further public health attention and resources.},

abstract = {The mainstay of diagnosis for Treponema pallidum infections is based on nontreponemal and treponemal serologic tests. Many new diagnostic methods for syphilis have been developed, using specific treponemal antigens and novel formats, including rapid point-of-care tests, enzyme immunoassays, and chemiluminescence assays. Although most of these newer tests are not yet cleared for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, their performance and ease of automation have promoted their application for syphilis screening. Both sensitive and specific, new screening tests detect antitreponemal IgM and IgG antibodies by use of wild-type or recombinant T. pallidum antigens. However, these tests cannot distinguish between recent and remote or treated versus untreated infections. In addition, the screening tests require confirmation with nontreponemal tests. This use of treponemal tests for screening and nontreponemal serologic tests as confirmatory tests is a reversal of long-held practice. Clinicians need to understand the science behind these tests to use them properly in syphilis management.},

We examined urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity among men who have sex with men (MSM) seen at San Francisco City Clinic (San Francisco, CA) during 2007. METHODS: All patients who sought care at the San Francisco City Clinic (the only municipal sexually transmitted disease clinic in San Francisco) received a standardized interview conducted by clinicians. We estimated urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity for 2 groups of visits by MSM who visited during 2007: (1) men who reported their only urethral exposure was receiving fellatio in the previous 3 months and (2) men who reported unprotected insertive anal sex in the previous 3 months. Additionally, urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity was estimated, stratified by human immunodeficiency virus infection status, urogenital symptom history, and whether the patient had been a contact to a sex partner with either chlamydia or gonorrhea. RESULTS: Among MSM who reported only receiving fellatio, urethral C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae positivity were 4.8{\%} and 4.1{\%}, respectively. These positivity estimates were similar to positivity found among MSM who reported unprotected insertive anal sex. CONCLUSIONS: A more complete understanding of the risks of transmission of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae from oropharynx to urethra will help inform prevention and screening programs.},

abstract = {CDC recommends screening of at-risk men who have sex with men (MSM) at least annually for urethral and rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia, and for pharyngeal gonorrhea. Although the standard method for diagnosis is culture, nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing is generally more sensitive and favored by most experts. NAA tests have not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the diagnosis of extragenital chlamydia or gonorrhea and may not be marketed for that purpose. However, under U.S. law, laboratories may offer NAA testing for diagnosis of extragenital chlamydia or gonorrhea after internal validation of the method by a verification study. To determine sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing practices among community-based organizations serving MSM, CDC and the San Francisco Department of Public Health gathered data on rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia testing at screening sites managed by six gay-focused community-based organizations in five U.S. cities during 2007. This report summarizes the results of the study, which found that three organizations collected samples for NAA testing and three for culture. In total, approximately 30,000 tests were performed; 5.4{\%} of rectal gonorrhea, 8.9{\%} of rectal chlamydia, 5.3{\%} of pharyngeal gonorrhea, and 1.6{\%} of pharyngeal chlamydia tests were positive. These results demonstrate that gay-focused community-based organizations can detect large numbers of gonorrhea and chlamydia cases and might reach MSM not being tested elsewhere. Public health officials could consider providing support to certain community-based organizations to facilitate testing and treatment of gonorrhea and chlamydia.},

abstract = {Gonorrhoea continues to be a public health problem in the UK, and is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) after chlamydia. In the UK, gonorrhoea is disproportionately concentrated in epidemiologically distinct subpopulations, with much higher incidence rates in young people, some ethnic minorities and inner city subpopulations. The original model of STI transmission proposed by Hethcote and Yorke explained some of these features through the concept of the 'core group'. Since then, several authors have modified the original model approach to include multiple sexual activity classes, but found this modelling approach to be inadequate when applied to low-prevalence settings such as the UK. We present a metapopulation framework for modelling gonorrhoea and other STIs. The model proposes that the epidemiology of gonorrhoea is largely driven by subpopulations with higher than average concentrations of individuals with high sexual risk activity. We show how this conceptualization of gonococcal epidemiology overcomes key limitations associated with some of the prior efforts to model gonorrhoea. We also use the model to explain several epidemiological features of gonorrhoea, such as its asymmetric distribution across subpopulations, and the contextual risk experienced by members of at-risk subpopulations. Finally, we extend the model to explain the distribution of other STIs, using chlamydia as an example of a more ubiquitous bacterial STI.},

The investigation focused on the selection of sexual partners, partner preferences, perceptions of HIV risk, and social mixing with respect to race/ethnicity. The sample of 1,142 MSM was 56{\%} White, 22{\%} Latino, 14{\%} Asian, and 9{\%} Black and reported on 3,532 sexual partnerships. Black MSM had a significant, three-fold higher level of same race sexual partnering than would be expected by chance alone (i.e., in the absence of selective forces with respect to race among partners). Black MSM were reported as the least preferred as sexual partners, believed at higher risk for HIV, counted less often among friends, were considered hardest to meet, and perceived as less welcome at the common venues that cater to gay men in San Francisco by other MSM. Our findings support the hypothesis that the sexual networks of Black MSM, constrained by the preferences and attitudes of non-Blacks and the social environment, are pushed to be more highly interconnected than other groups with the potential consequence of more rapid spread of HIV and a higher sustained prevalence of infection. The racial disparity in HIV observed for more than a decade will not disappear until the challenges posed by a legacy of racism towards Blacks in the US are addressed.},

We then review 4 specific social determinants relevant to STD disparities: segregation, health care, socioeconomics and correctional experiences, followed by 2 facets of the resultant epidemiologic context: core areas and sexual networks. This review shows that disparities exist among the social determinants and that they are related to each other, as well as to core areas, sexual networks, and STD rates. Finally, we discuss the implications of our review for STD prevention and control with particular attention to STD program collaboration and service integration.},

Results were weighted to represent the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population between 14 and 39 years of age.RESULTS:Prevalence of gonorrheal infection was 0.24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.16{\%} to 0.38{\%}). Prevalence of gonorrheal infection was higher among non-Hispanic black persons (1.2{\%} [CI, 0.7{\%} to 1.9{\%}]) than among non-Hispanic white persons (0.07{\%} [CI, 0.02{\%} to 0.24{\%}]). Among those with gonorrheal infection, 46{\%} also had chlamydial infection. Prevalence of chlamydial infection was 2.2{\%} (CI, 1.8{\%} to 2.8{\%}) and was similar between males (2.0{\%} [CI, 1.6{\%} to 2.5{\%}]) and females (2.5{\%} [CI, 1.8{\%} to 3.4{\%}]). Among females, the highest prevalence was in those age 14 to 19 years, whereas among males, it was highest in those age 14 to 29 years. Prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black persons (6.4{\%} [CI, 5.4{\%} to 7.5{\%}]) than non-Hispanic white persons (1.5{\%} [CI, 1.0{\%} to 2.4{\%}]). Among females with a history of gonorrhea or chlamydia in the previous 12 months, chlamydia prevalence was 16.7{\%} (CI, 5.5{\%} to 50.7{\%}).LIMITATIONS:The specificity of urine-based assays for chlamydia and gonorrhea is limited, and the possible misclassification of sexual experience status may have affected the accuracy of some estimates.CONCLUSIONS:The findings support current recommendations to screen sexually active females age 25 years or younger for chlamydia, to retest infected females for chlamydial infection, and to co-treat individuals with gonorrhea for chlamydia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Early detection and treatment of bacterial sexually transmitted infections has been advocated as an HIV prevention strategy. AIM To inform screening guidelines, the incidence and risk factors for urethral and anal gonorrhoea and chlamydia were studied in a prospective cohort of community-based HIV negative homosexual men in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. METHODS All participants were offered annual screening for gonorrhoea and chlamydia (study-visit diagnoses) on urine and anal swabs using nucleic acid amplification. Participants also reported diagnoses of gonorrhoea and chlamydia made elsewhere between interviews (interval diagnoses). All diagnoses were summed to create a combined incidence rate, and detailed data on specific sexual practices with casual and regular partners were collected. RESULTS Among 1427 men enrolled, the combined incidence rates were 3.49 and 2.96 per 100 person-years for urethral and anal gonorrhoea, respectively; and 7.43 and 4.98 per 100 person-years for urethral and anal chlamydia, respectively. Urethral infections were associated with unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with HIV-positive partners (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.58, 95{\%} CI 1.10 to 6.05 for urethral gonorrhoea) and with frequent insertive oral sex (p for trend 0.007 for urethral chlamydia). Anal infections were associated with receptive UAI (p for trend 0.001 for both anal gonorrhoea and chlamydia) and other receptive anal sexual practices. Stratified analyses showed the independence of the associations of insertive oral sex with urethral infections and of non-intercourse receptive anal practices with anal infections. CONCLUSION Incident gonorrhoea and chlamydia were common. Risk behaviours for both urethral and anal infections were not restricted to UAI. Screening that includes tests for anal and urethral infections should be considered for all sexually active homosexual men, not just for those who report UAI.},

STUDY DESIGN: GRASP is a sentinel surveillance program that monitors antimicrobial resistance to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Data collection occurs annually in June to August each year. RESULTS: Women with previously diagnosed gonorrhea had decreased odds of asymptomatic gonococcal infection, as did women diagnosed with other sexually transmitted infections (all except chlamydia, syphilis, herpes, and warts). Heterosexual men, but not women, coinfected with chlamydia had significantly higher likelihood of being diagnosed with asymptomatic gonorrhea, as did homosexual men coinfected with syphilis and warts. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity in correlates of asymptomatic gonorrhea has implications for screening in clinical settings. Such findings also depend on the extent of testing on sexually transmitted infections from different sites of infection, which has particular relevance in homosexual men and would thus need to be investigated in other studies.},

@article{Elford2006,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe changing patterns of sexual behaviour in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy among gay/bisexual men in Europe, Canada, USA and Australia. RECENT FINDINGS: While there has been a substantial increase in high-risk sexual behaviour among gay men since 1996, this now appears to be levelling off in some cities. Overall the empirical evidence does not support the suggestion that taking highly active antiretroviral therapy or having an undetectable viral load leads to risky sexual behaviour among people with HIV. Nor can HIV treatment optimism alone explain the recent increase in high-risk sexual behaviour. Since 1996, an increasing number of gay men have begun to use the Internet to look for sexual partners. By serosorting on the Internet, HIV-positive men are more likely to meet online, rather than off-line, other HIV-positive men for unprotected sex. While serosorting does not present a risk of HIV transmission to an uninfected person, it does present a risk of other sexually transmitted infections and co-infection with resistant virus for HIV-positive men themselves. This review also explores emerging behaviours such as barebacking and strategic positioning as well as the role of crystal meth and Viagra. SUMMARY: The review reminds us of the complexity of human and sexual behaviour. Among gay men, sexual behaviour in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy has been characterized by risk reduction and stabilization as well as increasing risk. These changing patterns provide a new challenge as well as new opportunities for HIV prevention.},

Using a model of gonorrhea transmission dynamics, we obtain generally applicable, qualitative results that show how compensatory mutations lead to more likely and faster resistance emergence. We further show that resistance emergence depends on the level of drug use in a strongly nonlinear fashion. We also discuss what data need to be obtained to allow future quantitative predictions of resistance emergence.},

abstract = {Background: The prevalence of gonorrhea (GC) among adolescent and young women attending some urban emergency departments (EDs) ranges from 1{\%} to 7{\%}, but historically screening has not been logistically practical. Goal: The primary goal of the study was to assess the cost effectiveness of GC screening in women ages 15 to 29, seeking care in urban EDs, using noninvasive or rapid point-of-care tests. Study: We developed a state-transition Markov model to compare the net lifetime health consequences, costs, and cost effectiveness of routine ED care (no screening for women without genitourinary symptoms) to GC screening using 1 of 5 detection methods: Gram-stained smears of endocervical swab specimens, urine-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), NAATs performed on endocervical swabs, rapid immunochromotographic strip test (RIS) performed on clinician-collected vaginal swabs, and RIS on patient-collected vaginal swabs. Results: Screening women between 15 and 29 years of age using urine-based NAATs prevented 1247 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and saved {\$}177 per patient compared with no screening. Compared with urine-based NAAT, screening with RIS using clinician-obtained vaginal swabs prevented an additional 220 cases of PID and had an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of {\$}6490 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results were sensitive to assumptions about loss to follow-up, gonorrhea prevalence, and test costs. Conclusion: Screening females aged 15 to 29 for gonorrhea in some urban EDs will prevent substantial reproductive morbidity. Screening with rapid, point-of-care tests is cost effective compared with other well-accepted preventive interventions.},

Little is known about how patterns of contact between SWs and their clients influence the persistence of STIs. We developed an individual-based simulation model to explore how variation in number of client contacts per SW, whether clients repeatedly visited the same SW, and the relative sizes of the SW and client populations influence the endemic prevalence of gonorrhea and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection. Persistence of either infection was more likely if clients visited many different SWs, regardless of variation in the SW-client contact rate, and also resulted in a higher endemic prevalence in both populations and a greater likelihood of persistence of infection at lower levels in the general population. The size of the SW population (relative to the total population) was found to be most important in determining the overall prevalence of infection.},

abstract = {Community-randomized trials in Mwanza, Tanzania, and Rakai and Masaka, Uganda, suggested that population characteristics were an important determinant of the impact of sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment interventions on incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We performed simulation modeling of HIV and STI transmission, which confirmed that the low trial impact in Rakai and Masaka could be explained by low prevalences of curable STI resulting from lower-risk sexual behavior in Uganda. The mature HIV epidemics in Uganda, with most HIV transmission occurring outside core groups with high STI rates, also contributed to the low impact on HIV incidence. Simulated impact on HIV was much greater in Mwanza, although the observed impact was larger than predicted from STI reductions, suggesting that random error also may have played some role. Of proposed alternative explanations, increasing herpetic ulceration due to HIV-related immunosuppression contributed little to the diminishing impact of antibiotic treatment during the Ugandan epidemics. The strategy of STI treatment also was unimportant, since syndromic treatment and annual mass treatment showed similar effectiveness in simulations of each trial population. In conclusion, lower-risk behavior and the mature HIV epidemic explain the limited impact of STI treatment on HIV incidence in Uganda in the 1990s. In populations with high-risk sexual behavior and high STI rates, STIs treatment interventions may contribute substantially to prevention of HIV infection.},

In the face of the increasing incidence of sexually transmitted infection, the ability of genitourinary medicine services to provide appropriate and timely care is reduced. To explore the relationship between capacity and demand for care, we developed and analyzed a mathematical model of gonorrhea transmission, incorporating patient flow through treatment services and heterogeneity in sexual risk behavior. Two equilibrium levels of infection incidence--"high" and "low"--exist for the same parameter values, and which of them occurs depends on starting conditions. At the high-incidence equilibrium, there is a "vicious circle" in which inadequate treatment capacity leads to many untreated infections, generating further high incidence and high demand and thus maintaining the inadequacy of services. A substantial increase in capacity is needed to interrupt this process and enter a "virtuous circle," in which adequate service provision keeps demand low, offering cost savings as well as improvements in health.},

First-void urine specimens using ligase chain reaction assay were available for 12,548 (87.6{\%}) of the Wave III participants.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Prevalences of chlamydial and gonococcal infections in the general young adult population, and by age, self-reported race/ethnicity, and geographic region of current residence.RESULTS:Overall prevalence of chlamydial infection was 4.19{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3.48{\%}-4.90{\%}). Women (4.74{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 3.93{\%}-5.71{\%}) were more likely to be infected than men (3.67{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 2.93{\%}-4.58{\%}; prevalence ratio, 1.29; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.63). The prevalence of chlamydial infection was highest among black women (13.95{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 11.25{\%}-17.18{\%}) and black men (11.12{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 8.51{\%}-14.42{\%}); lowest prevalences were among Asian men (1.14{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 0.40{\%}-3.21{\%}), white men (1.38{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 0.93{\%}-2.03{\%}), and white women (2.52{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 1.90{\%}-3.34{\%}). Prevalence of chlamydial infection was highest in the south (5.39{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 4.24{\%}-6.83{\%}) and lowest in the northeast (2.39{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 1.56{\%}-3.65{\%}). Overall prevalence of gonorrhea was 0.43{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.29{\%}-0.63{\%}). Among black men and women, the prevalence was 2.13{\%} (95{\%} CI, 1.46{\%}-3.10{\%}) and among white young adults, 0.10{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.03{\%}-0.27{\%}). Prevalence of coinfection with both chlamydial and gonococcal infections was 0.030{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0.18{\%}-0.49{\%}).CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence of chlamydial infection is high among young adults in the United States. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities are present in the prevalence of both chlamydial and gonococcal infections.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To determine whether population differences can explain the contrasting impacts on HIV observed in the Mwanza trial of sexually transmitted disease (STD) syndromic treatment (ST), the Rakai trial of STD mass treatment (MT), and the Masaka trial of information, education, and communication (IEC) with and without ST as well as to predict the effectiveness of each intervention strategy in each population.METHODS:Stochastic modeling of the transmission of HIV and 6 STDs was used with parameters fitted to demographic, sexual behavior, and epidemiological data from the trials and general review of STD/HIV biology.RESULTS:The baseline trial populations could be simulated by assuming higher risk behavior in Uganda compared with Mwanza in the 1980s, followed by reductions in risk behavior in Uganda preceding the trials. In line with trial observations, the projected HIV impacts were larger for the ST intervention in Mwanza than for the MT intervention in Rakai or the IEC and IEC + ST interventions in Masaka. All 4 simulated intervention strategies were more effective in reducing incidence of HIV infection in Mwanza than in either Rakai or Masaka.CONCLUSIONS:Population differences in sexual behavior, curable STD rates, and HIV epidemic stage can explain most of the contrast in HIV impact observed between the 3 trials. This study supports the hypothesis that STD management is an effective HIV prevention strategy in populations with a high prevalence of curable STDs, particularly in an early HIV epidemic.},

METHOD: A cross sectional survey of new patients attending a mainly walk-in outer London GUM clinic, in which responses were linked to clinical data. RESULTS: 40.5{\%} of all patients and 39.9{\%} of those with an STI had already seen a GP for their current problem. This did not vary with age or symptom status. Duration of symptoms was highly significantly longer in patients who had attended a GP than in patients who attended a GUM clinic in the first instance. When patients who had not seen a GP were asked the reason for this, a third of responses cited the convenience of a GUM clinic or difficulty in accessing primary care services, while only 3{\%} cited embarrassment and only 2{\%} examination or gender issues. CONCLUSION: Many patients initially attend GP services for STIs, and primary care is therefore already an important setting with potential for STI control. However, delay in treatment through attendance at primary care, and barriers in access to primary care, need to be addressed in the planning of future services.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The United States has the highest prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in the developed world. Control strategies should address the most frequent reasons why curable sexually transmitted diseases are not treated. METHODS: We approached 1,631 persons ages 18-29 in various sites and offered them screening for gonorrhea and chlamydial infection and surveys regarding past genitourinary symptoms. For those with past symptoms we abstracted medical records or conducted additional interviews. From these data we estimated the total number of persons who had gonorrhea or chlamydial infections in the previous year, the proportion treated, and the primary reasons for nontreatment. RESULTS: The prevalence of gonorrhea was 2.3{\%} and that of chlamydial infection was 10.1{\%}. We estimate that 45 and 77{\%} of all cases of gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, respectively, were never symptomatic and that 86 and 95{\%} of untreated cases of gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, respectively, were untreated because they were never symptomatic. The remaining 14 and 5{\%} of untreated cases of gonorrhea and chlamydia, respectively, were not treated because persons did not receive medical care for symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The primary reason that gonorrhea and chlamydial infections are untreated is that infected persons never have symptoms. The most effective method to control these sexually transmitted diseases is routine screening at high-volume sites.},

abstract = {The same sexual behaviours that transmit HIV are implicated in the transmission of certain other STDs, including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis. Consequently, it is often assumed that preventive methods that are effective against HIV should be equally effective against other STDs. The purpose of this study was to examine this assumption. We applied a mathematical model of HIV/STD transmission to empirical data from a large HIV prevention intervention that stressed sexual behaviour change. We modelled the effects of two behavioural strategies - reducing the number of sex partners and increasing condom use-on the proportionate change in intervention participants' cumulative risk of acquiring HIV or a highly-infectious STD, such as gonorrhoea. The results of this modelling exercise indicate that decreasing the number of partners is a more effective strategy for reducing STD risk than it is for HIV risk. In contrast, condoms are somewhat more effective at reducing the cumulative transmission risk for HIV than for highly infectious STDs. The protection provided by condoms for multiple acts of intercourse critically depends on the infectiousness of the STD. The results of this study suggest caution in extrapolating from one STD to another, or from one behavioural risk reduction strategy to another.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:Most current tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlmydia trachomatis require the support of a laboratory, and results are not usually available before the patient has left the clinic. This delay can lead to patients not returning for treatment and may allow further STI transmission to occur. Current rapid point of care (POC) STI tests and the syndromic approach are less sensitive than gold standard tests, but allow treatment at the initial visit. This study estimates the required sensitivity of POC tests that ensures as many STIs are averted as with current gold standard tests.METHODS:A mathematical model is developed to compare the STIs averted using different STI diagnostic methods. Data from Benin, South Africa, Tanzania, and England are used to explore how the required sensitivity differs between settings.RESULTS:The required sensitivity of a POC test is low if there is significant STI transmission during the delay in treatment for the gold standard test and/or few women return for treatment. For example, the required sensitivity of a POC test for C trachomatis is 50{\%} (gold standard test sensitivity is 90{\%}) if either 55{\%} return for treatment and there is no STI transmission, or 80{\%} return for treatment and 50{\%} of infected women infect their partner during the delay in treatment. Furthermore, in these settings a POC test of moderate sensitivity can lead to significantly more STI averted than the gold standard test.CONCLUSIONS:These results support the use of moderate sensitivity POC tests in scenarios where many women will not return for treatment, and in populations where the delay in treatment would result in significant STI transmission.},

abstract = {Mathematical models have highlighted the disproportionate contribution of core group transmitters to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Because the effectiveness of interventions varies with time, it has been suggested that epidemic phases should be considered in the design of prevention strategies. This study aimed to examine the impact of HIV epidemic phases on the effectiveness of HIV interventions based on gonorrhoea screening and condom use, targeted to core groups. The results are based on a mathematical model of gonorrhoea and HIV transmission in a relatively slow spreading HIV epidemic using Cotonou (Benin) as an example. For epidemics with a low reproductive potential modest core group interventions can significantly reduce HIV incidence and prevalence. As the epidemic matures, effective interventions should also incorporate core and non-core populations. For epidemics with a high reproductive potential, core group interventions are necessary but not sufficient to have a rapid and large scale impact. A more general population approach is also needed early in the epidemic. Epidemic phases are also important in the evaluation of prevention strategies.},

The implied network structure is vital in determining disease dynamics, especially when the average number of connections per individual is small as is the case for many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

These models are compared with full stochastic simulations and show excellent agreement across a wide range of parameters. We show how such models can be used to estimate parameters of epidemiological importance, and how they can be extended to examine the effectiveness of various control strategies, in particular screening programs and contact tracing.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of syndromic treatment as an STD control strategy depends on the proportion of episodes which become symptomatic; few studies have measured this directly. We estimated these proportions for gonorrhoea (NG) and chlamydia (CT), synthesizing data on the point prevalence of self-reported discharge and dysuria among infected cases in rural Uganda, the durations of symptoms, incubation period and asymptomatic episodes, and the effect of treatment on symptom duration. Estimated proportions of episodes that become symptomatic were 45{\%} for males with NG, 11{\%} for males with CT, 14{\%} for females with NG and 6{\%} for females with CT. This was on average 1.5-fold higher than symptom prevalence at cross-section among infected cases in this population. Estimates were sensitive to assumptions on the relative durations of asymptomatic and symptomatic episodes, but were invariably inconsistent with previous direct estimates based on a US cohort study. These results show that the probability of recognizing symptoms in NG and CT episodes varies between settings. In populations with low treatment rates like Uganda, these probabilities can be very low. Here, health education should have priority in STD management programmes.},

Main outcome measures were untreated gonorrhea or chlamydia cases and their sequelae, transmission to a partner, congenital outcomes, and cost to prevent a case. This analysis, from the perspective of the healthcare sector, included medical case costs expressed in US dollars (1999), discounted at an annual rate of 3{\%}.RESULTS:Mass treatment was the most cost-effective strategy among women and men. Of the screening strategies for women, universal screening combined with standard practice was the most cost-effective; it was used for treating 499 more cases of gonorrhea and chlamydia than was standard practice, saving {\$}95.70 per case treated. Standard ED practice remained the most cost-effective strategy for men under a variety of circumstances.CONCLUSION:The authors recommend urine ligase chain reaction screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia in women aged 18 years to 31 years in the ED, in conjunction with standard ED practice, to decrease the occurrence of the sequelae and costs associated with infection.},

Development of nucleic acid amplification tests, such as the ligase chain reaction assay, provides new opportunities to estimate the prevalence of untreated infections in the population.OBJECTIVE:To estimate the overall prevalence of untreated gonococcal and chlamydial infections and to describe patterns of infection within specific demographic subgroups of the young adult population in Baltimore, Md.DESIGN AND SETTING:Cross-sectional behavioral survey based on a probability sample of Baltimore households with collection of urine specimens between January 1997 and September 1998.PARTICIPANTS:A total of 728 adults aged 18 to 35 years completed the interview portion of the study, and 579 of these respondents also provided a urine specimen adequate for testing.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:Prevalence of untreated infection, as measured by the percentage of specimens testing positive for gonococcal and chlamydial infection by ligase chain reaction, weighted to reflect variations in probabilities of sample selection from the population. Alternate estimates of the prevalence of recent treated infection were derived from clinically diagnosed cases reported to the Baltimore City Health Department and by diagnoses reported by participants in the survey.RESULTS:An estimated 5.3{\%} (SE, 1.4{\%}) of the population aged 18 to 35 years has an untreated gonococcal infection, and 3.0{\%} (SE, 0.8{\%}) is estimated to have an untreated chlamydial infection. While 7.9{\%} (SE, 1.6{\%}) of the population is estimated to have either an untreated gonococcal or chlamydial infection, estimated prevalence is substantially higher among black women (15.0{\%}; SE, 3.7{\%}). Few participants with untreated infections reported dysuria or discharge during the 6 months preceding testing. The estimated number of untreated gonococcal infections in the population (9241; SE, 2441) substantially exceeds both the number of such infections diagnosed among Baltimore adults aged 18 to 35 years and reported to the Baltimore City Health Department during 1998 (4566), and the estimated number of diagnoses derived using participants' reports for the 12 months prior to the survey (4708 [SE, 1918] to 5231 [SE, 2092]). The estimated number of untreated chlamydial infections (5231; SE, 1395) is also greater than the number of cases reported to the health department in 1998 (3664) but is slightly less than the estimated number of diagnoses derived using participants' reports of chlamydial infections diagnosed during the 12 months prior to the survey (5580 [SE, 1918] to 6975 [SE, 2441]).CONCLUSION:In 1997-1998, the estimated number of undiagnosed gonococcal and chlamydial infections prevalent in the population of Baltimore adults aged 18 to 35 years approached or exceeded the number of infections that were diagnosed and treated annually.},

The optimum strategy for an organism to overcome treatment, either through drug resistance or cryptic infections, depends upon whether the method for identifying patients is passive (treating symptoms alone favours asymptomatic organisms) or active (screening favours resistant organisms). The use of mathematical models of competing strains of infection allows theoretical predictions for the outcome of evolution under a range of assumptions about potential phenotypes. The course of pathogen evolution has implications for the success of interventions, but the predictions presented need to be tested at the level of the community in carefully monitored interventions.},

The networks are formulated as transmission graphs (TGs), in which nodes represent relationships between two individuals and directed edges (links) represent the potential of an individual in one relationship to carry infection to an individual in another relationship. Network measures derived from transmission graphs include "source counts," which are defined as the number of prior relationships that could potentially transmit infection to a particular node or individual.},

However, the many different STDs may contribute in different ways, at different magnitudes. GOAL: To review available studies on the bidirectional interactions of HIV and STDs to explore the extent of current knowledge on the different influences of the varied STDs in heterosexual HIV epidemics. METHODS: Longitudinal studies on susceptibility and controlled studies on infectiousness and duration of disease identified on electronic databases through reference lists and citation indices up to the end of 1999 were systematically reviewed, including meta-analyses assessing the influence of STDs on susceptibility to HIV. RESULTS: Studies have a clear publication bias with a significant result that hinders robust interpretation. However, genital ulcerative disease appears to have a greater impact than nonulcerative disease, and men are more affected than women by the effects of STDs on susceptibility to HIV. There is evidence that STDs increase the infectiousness of HIV from men to women, whereas the evidence is more equivocal for the infectiousness of women. Few studies identify the impact of different STDs, and there is a marked lack of studies investigating the impact of HIV infection on the transmission of other STDs. CONCLUSIONS: A large body of work has measured the association between STDs and HIV. However, publication bias and gaps in the focus of studies mean that a detailed, quantitative understanding of the interaction requires much more attention.},

abstract = {Deterministic differential equation models indicate that partnership concurrency and non-homogeneous mixing patterns play an important role in the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Stochastic discrete-individual simulation studies arrive at similar conclusions, but from a very different modeling perspective. This paper presents a stochastic discrete-individual infection model that helps to unify these two approaches to infection modeling. The model allows for both partnership concurrency, as well as the infection, recovery, and reinfection of an individual from repeated contact with a partner, as occurs with many mucosal infections. The simplest form of the model is a network-valued Markov chain, where the network's nodes are individuals and arcs represent partnerships. Connections between the differential equation and discrete-individual approaches are constructed with large-population limits that approximate endemic levels and equilibrium probability distributions that describe partnership concurrency. A more general form of the discrete-individual model that allows for semi-Markovian dynamics and heterogeneous contact patterns is implemented in simulation software. Analytical and simulation results indicate that the basic reproduction number R(0) increases when reinfection is possible, and the epidemic rate of rise and endemic levels are not related by 1-1/R(0), when partnerships are not point-time processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of safe and effective treatment, infection with bacterial sexually transmitted diseases persists at a high prevalence in many populations. GOAL: To review the difficulties of parameter estimation when a cure is readily available and to explore the impact of different treatment and screening strategies that might maximize the benefits of using available treatments. STUDY DESIGN: A standard deterministic model for the spread of a bacterial sexually transmitted disease that causes symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, in which the population is stratified according to sex and sexual activity, is further stratified into two host groups to enable the modeling of different treatment and screening strategies. RESULTS: In the presence of a core group, if an infection has a high transmission probability, then screening for asymptomatic infections has a short-lived benefit. Repeated screening is slightly better if it is not restricted to a fraction of the at-risk population, but targeting of high-risk groups should be effective. Screening to treat asymptomatic infections in men could be beneficial if a substantial fraction of cases remain asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: After the initial gains achieved through treating symptomatic infections, further reductions in the prevalence of infections can be achieved by finding asymptomatic infections. However, these gains are difficult to achieve, especially in the case of gonorrhea. Because men are likely to have an asymptomatic chlamydial infection, screening of men for chlamydia should be worthwhile.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To compare the impact of single-round mass treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), sustained syndromic treatment and their combination on the incidence of HIV in rural Africa.METHODS:We studied the effects of STD interventions by stochastic simulation using the model STDSIM. Parameters were fitted using data from a trial of improved STD treatment services in Mwanza, Tanzania. Effectiveness was assessed by comparing the prevalences of gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and chancroid, and the incidence of HIV, in the general adult population in simulations with and without intervention.RESULTS:Single-round mass treatment was projected to achieve an immediate, substantial reduction in STD prevalences, which would return to baseline levels over 5-10 years. The effect on syphilis was somewhat larger if participants cured of latent syphilis were not immediately susceptible to re-infection. At 80{\%} coverage, the model projected a reduction in cumulative HIV incidence over 2 years of 36{\%}. A similar impact was achieved if treatment of syphilis was excluded from the intervention or confined to those in the infectious stages. In comparison with sustained syndromic treatment, single-round mass treatment had a greater short-term impact on HIV (36 versus 30{\%} over 2 years), but a smaller long-term impact (24 versus 62{\%} over 10 years). Mass treatment combined with improved treatment services led to a rapid and sustained fall in HIV incidence (57{\%} over 2 years; 70{\%} over 10 years).CONCLUSIONS:In populations in which STD control can reduce HIV incidence, mass treatment may, in the short run, have an impact comparable to sustained syndromic treatment. Mass treatment combined with sustained syndromic treatment may be particularly effective.},

A major limitation in the development of gonococcal vaccines has been the lack of an animal model. Urethral infection can be initiated in male volunteer subjects through urethral inoculation. Several hundred patients have participated in studies using this experimental infection model. These studies have helped define the natural history of experimental infection and provided a better understanding of phenotypic and genotypic variation of gonococci in vivo. Isogenic molecular mutants can be used to define a role for gonococcal surface structures, including pilin and transferrin-binding proteins; recent results demonstrate that gonococci unable to express transferrin- and lactoferrin-binding proteins cannot cause urethral infection. The experimental model has proven to be an efficient means of studying gonococcal infection and focusing vaccine development. In addition, this model should allow vaccines to be tested quickly and efficiently.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have observed that African Americans have comparatively high rates of selected STDs, often 10 to 20 times higher than whites and other racial/ethnic groups, but without convincing explanation. GOAL: This study attempts to solve this puzzle using data from a nationally representative probability sample and a network approach. STUDY DESIGN: The National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) is a nationally representative probability sample of 1,511 men and 1,921 women in the United States. Logistic regression analysis of these data permit a multivariate analysis of the individual risk factors associated with STDs. Using loglinear analysis and a simulation, we also identify the effects of sexual network patterns within and between racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis of the NHSLS revealed, even after controlling for all the appropriate individual-level risk factors, that African Americans are almost five times more likely to be infected by bacterial diseases than the other racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: African Americans' higher infection rate for bacterial diseases can be explained by the patterns of sexual networks within and between different racial/ethnic groups. First, infections are more widespread in the African American population at large because partner choice is more highly dissortative--meaning that "peripheral" African Americans (who have had only one partner in the past year) are five times more likely to choose "core' African Americans (who have had four or more partners in the past year) than "peripheral" whites are to choose "core" whites. Secondly, sexually transmitted infections stay within the African American population because their partner choices are more segregated (assortative mating) than other groups. The likelihood of African Americans having a sexually transmitted infection is 1.3 times greater than it is for whites because of this factor alone.},

When more than one antibiotic is employed, sequential use of different antibiotics in the population ("cycling") is always inferior to treatment strategies where, at any given time, equal fractions of the population receive different antibiotics.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Syphilis remains a significant cause of morbidity in many developing countries and in some areas within North America and Europe. Mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of sexually transmitted infections have provided insights of relevance both to the interpretation of observed epidemiological patterns and to the design of control programs. Their use for the study of syphilis has been limited to date. GOALS AND STUDY DESIGN: The authors investigated the transmission dynamics of syphilis against a template based on the natural history of infection in individual patients with the aim of (1) identifying gaps in our understanding of the biology of infection, and (2) providing insights of relevance to the design of control policies. RESULTS Analyses reveal that Treponema pallidum has a moderate to high probability of transmission during contact between susceptible and infectious sexual partners. This, combined with questions over the existence of any immunity to reinfection, helps to ensure the long-term persistence of syphilis within "core" activity groups. Patterns of treatment in North America are shown to have significantly altered the relative frequency of individuals in the different stages of disease. CONCLUSIONS The analyses emphasize the benefits to be gained from treating infected people early in the primary stage of infection to reduce the effective period during which infected people can transmit to others. This form of treatment is beneficial for both the individual and the community. Treatment has greatly altered the incidence of different disease stages, but the full implications of treatment depend on whether immunity is present.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite trends toward safer sex practices in homosexually active men, some such people remain at high risk for acquiring sexually transmitted diseases (STD). This study was designed to assess behavioral and demographic determinants of STD acquisition in men who have sex with men (MSM), to guide prevention interventions. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional medical record review was undertaken of MSM who attended an urban STD clinic from January, 1993 through December, 1994. Gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, Chlamydia-negative nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), and newly documented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were analyzed in relation to demographic and behavioral variables. RESULTS: Among 1,253 MSM, 196 (15.6{\%}) had nonchlamydial NGU, 105 (8.4{\%}) had gonorrhea, 31 (2.5{\%}) had chlamydial infection, and 162 (12.9{\%}) had known or newly documented HIV infection. Known HIV infection was an independent predictor of urethral gonorrhea (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI95] 1.2-4.8). Oral insertive intercourse was independently associated with urethral gonorrhea (OR 4.4, CI95 1.4-13.4) and nonchlamydial NGU (OR 2.2, CI95 1.3-3.7), and receptive anal intercourse was associated with newly documented HIV infection (OR 2.6, CI95 1.3-4.9). Neither number of sex partners nor condom use was associated with any incident STD outcome, including new HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: MSM who attend STD clinics represent a subgroup of homosexually active men who remain at high risk for STDs, including HIV infection. Fellatio, commonly thought to be a "safe" sexual practice, is an independent risk factor for urethral gonorrhea and nonchlamydial NGU. A history of consistent condom use or of few sex partners should not dissuade clinicians from performing screening tests for HIV and other STDs. Repeated STD screening and counseling about safer sex are indicated for many HIV-infected MSM.},

abstract = {Core population groups play an important role in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Subjects in a core group may change their behavior over time and "migrate" to the noncore. The authors examined the effects of such migration on the prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using a mathematical model. The size of the core and the migration rate from the core to the noncore were estimated from population-based sexual survey data on 8,445 Norwegians collected in 1987 and 1992. Sixty-four percent of the sample was considered without risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. The core group made up 2.5{\%} of the remaining sample. The migration rate from the core was estimated at 12{\%} per year. The three types of infections analyzed exemplify three different patterns of the effect of migration on infection prevalence in the core/noncore groups: gonorrhea = no effect/no effect, Chlamydia = no effect/increase, and HIV = decrease/increase. Migration affects the basic reproductive ratio of diseases with a long infectious period more than that of diseases with a short infectious period. For HIV, this means that the later stages of infection contribute less to the basic reproductive ratio in the presence of migration. The results are qualitative and show that detailed knowledge about mixing, migration, transmission rates, and duration of infectiousness is necessary to make accurate predictions.},

abstract = {AIM: To review the features of gonococcal infection in men in the 1990s. METHODS: A retrospective study of all men with gonorrhoea presenting to an inner city department of genitourinary medicine in the years 1990 to 1992. RESULTS: 1749 cases of gonorrhoea were seen in 1382 men. A high incidence of gonorrhoea was found in attenders of African or Caribbean extraction. In 228 men with a known date of infection, the incubation period, a mean of 8.3 days, was longer than previously described. The mean infectious period was 12.0 days. By 14 days 86.2{\%} of men had developed symptoms. Of 1615 men with urethral infection 81.9{\%} complained of discharge, while dysuria occurred in 52.8{\%}. Discharge with dysuria were present in only 48.1{\%} of patients. In 10.2{\%} episodes of urethral infection the patients had no symptoms referable to their gonorrhoea. Urethral gonorrhoea was diagnosed by microscopy in 94.4{\%} of symptomatic men and in only 81.1{\%} of asymptomatic men. Microscopy of rectal samples were positive in 46.4{\%} of cases. In this population, a dose of 2 g of ampicillin with 1 g of probenecid gave a high cure rate of gonorrhoea as long as infection was not due to penicillinase-producing organisms. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the incubation and infectious period of urethral gonorrhoea has increased compared with previous studies and that symptoms have altered. Only 48.1{\%} of men described the classical symptoms of discharge with dysuria. Microscopy of urethral smears remains useful in symptomatic men but is less sensitive in those without symptoms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Sexual behaviour data are crucial for understanding the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Over a period (1987-1992) in which the HIV epidemic increased public awareness of safe sexual practices, we describe predictors of condom use, changes in condom use over time, and the estimated effects of these changes on the spread of STD.METHODS:Condom use reported by females aged 18-35 years with non-cohabiting partners was analysed using data from two cross-sectional postal surveys performed 5 years apart (1987 and 1992) on two separate representative samples of 10,000 subjects aged 18-60 years living in Norway. A simple mathematical model was used to assess the effects of selection bias. A more complicated model was used to predict the effects of condom use on the prevalence of STD in a population which includes a core group of highly sexually active subjects.RESULTS:We found an increase in the prevalence of condom use in the latest intercourse from 14{\%} to 20{\%} with non-foreign partners and from 10{\%} to 38{\%} with foreign partners, from 1987 to 1992. In a logistic regression model, low frequency of intercourse, high education, one lifetime partner, and late sexual debut were predictors for condom use. Controlled for these variables, the odds ratio (OR) for condom use in 1992 versus 1987 was 1.4 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-2.0) if the partner was non-foreign, and 7.1 (95{\%} CI: 2.5-20.5) if the partner was foreign. Not using other contraceptive methods was a strong predictor for condom use; OR = 17.4 (95{\%} CI: 8.0-38.0). Condom use in the first intercourse with the last partner was a strong predictor for condom use in the last intercourse; OR = 19.2 (95{\%} CI: 8.2-45.3). It appeared unlikely that the increase in condom use could be explained by response bias. The predicted reductions in STD prevalence due to the increase in condom use ranged from zero to 30{\%} depending on consistency of use, and on the agent that is transmitted.CONCLUSIONS:Condom use among 18-35 year old women has increased over the period, particularly with foreign partners. Condoms are used primarily as contraception. The prevalences of STD with high transmission rates are not reduced by inconsistent condom use, while the prevalences of STD with low transmission rates are reduced by both consistent and inconsistent condom use. Condom use in a core group is more effective for reducing the STD prevalence than condom use in the non-core group for gonorrhoea and HIV. For chlamydial infection, condom use in the non-core group is more effective.Cross-sectional postal surveys were performed in 1987 and 1992 on two separate representative samples of 10,000 subjects aged 18-60 years living in Norway. Data from these two surveys were used to determine the level of reported condom use among females aged 18-35 years with noncohabiting partners. The HIV epidemic and associated prevention and control efforts over the period between the two surveys increased public awareness of safe sex practices. Over the period 1987-92, the prevalence of condom use at last intercourse increased from 14{\%} to 20{\%} with nonforeign partners and from 10{\%} to 38{\%} with foreign partners. Low frequency of intercourse, high level of education, one lifetime partner, and late sexual debut were predictors for condom use. Controlling for these variables, the odds ratio for condom use in 1992 compared to 1987 was 1.4 with nonforeign partners and 7.1 with foreign partners. Not using other contraceptive methods was a strong predictor for condom use, with an odds ratio of 17.4, while condom use in the first intercourse with the last partner strongly predicted condom use at the last intercourse, with an odds ratio of 19.2. It is not likely that the increase in condom use is the result of response bias. The authors note that condoms are used mainly for contraception. While the prevalences of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) with high transmission rates are not reduced by inconsistent condom use, the prevalences of STD with low transmission rates are reduced by both consistent and inconsistent condom use. Furthermore, condom use in a core group is more effective than condom use in the non-core group for reducing the prevalence of gonorrhea and HIV. For chlamydial infection, however, condom use in the non-core group is more effective.},

The model represents an extension of previous studies with a special focus on patterns of mixing or contact between sexual activity and different age classes of the two sexes. A range of mixing patterns between these groups is specified for both sexes. Mixing is described on two scales from fully assortative to fully disassortative, with random defined either according to numbers of sexual partnerships or numbers of people. The sexual partnerships in the model are balanced by changes in the rates of sexual partner acquisition between particular groups and a range of changes, from only women changing behaviour to only men changing behaviour, are analysed. The pattern of mixing is most influential in determining the shape and magnitude of the epidemic, but the manner in which people choose partners (i.e. dependent on numbers or proportions in the population) is also important. The relative importance of variation in transmission probabilities and mean rates of partner change on the course of the HIV epidemic is also illustrated. The analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to changing parameters in the force of infection term of the model provides a theoretical basis from which the influence of control strategies and the demographic effects of HIV can be analysed.},

GOAL OF THIS STUDY AND STUDY DESIGN: Simple mathematical models are used to assess the significance of sexual mixing between core and noncore groups.

abstract = {To ascertain the prevalence of self-medication with antimicrobial agents among patients attending a clinic for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), we administered a questionnaire to and collected a urine specimen for antimicrobial testing from 551 patients before treatment. We defined self-medication as an antimicrobial agent taken on the patient's own initiative by self-report during the week before the visit to the clinic or a positive urine assay for antimicrobial agents at the time of the clinic visit. We tested urine for the presence of antimicrobial agents by a disk diffusion method using Sarcina lutea as the test organism. A total of 75 (14{\%}) of the 551 participants were self-medicators: 19 reported antimicrobial use and had a positive urine test, 27 reported antimicrobial use but had a negative urine test, and 29 denied antimicrobial use but had a positive urine test. Thus, 29 (60{\%}) of the 48 patients with antimicrobial agents detected in their urine at the time of the clinic visit denied self-medication. Self-medicators acquired their antibiotics either from their medicine cabinet (44{\%}) or from a family member or friend (56{\%}). Self-medication was associated with self-report of prior use of unprescribed antimicrobial agents (P {\textless} .0001). We concluded that use of unprescribed antimicrobial agents (usually beta-lactam agents or tetracyclines) among STD clinic attendees in our study was common and that self-reporting was not a reliable method of screening for self-medicators.},

A relatively rapid but small epidemic can be expected if sexual mixing patterns are highly assortative so that those with high partner change rates nearly always choose partners with similar rates. Direct estimation of sexual mixing is exceedingly difficult. On the other hand, information on the way people mix is implicitly contained in the epidemiology of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If mixing is highly assortative, one might expect gonorrhea to be largely confined to a small subsection of the population who would frequently contract the disease repeatedly. In this paper a model of gonorrhea transmission in which partner change rates and preference are dealt with as continuous variables is used to extract information on mixing from data on an Australian heterosexual population. It was found that in this population mixing is not far from random with respect to partner change rates.},

Analyses also demonstrate that the pattern of mixing (assortative to random) between the sexual activity classes has an important influence on the predicted prevalence of gonococcal infection in a defined community.

Using the model, the impact that such a disease could have for a range of possible parameters is examined. Then a full parameter set for gonorrhoea in a developing country is estimated. Analysis demonstrates the significant influence gonococcal infection may have in reducing population growth rate in some communities. For example, the simple model predicts that a prevalence of 20{\%} in sexually active adults results in a 50{\%} reduction in the population growth rate.

Combining epidemiological and demographic data within the framework of a mathematical model, we show that gonorrhoea has a major impact on fertility and, concomitantly, on net population growth in areas with a high prevalence of untreated infections. Specifically, a 20{\%} prevalence in sexually active adults is predicted to induce a 50{\%} reduction in net population growth. Model predictions are in good agreement with observed data from Uganda, and the sensitivity of the prediction to various complications, such as heterogeneity in sexual behaviour, is assessed. The analysis suggests that the predicted increase in fertility arising from expanded sexually transmitted disease (STD) control programmes in Africa to help combat the spread of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) will help to offset the predicted demographic impact of AIDS in the worst afflicted areas. In other areas the rise in fertility associated with effective STD control will need to be countered by the linkage of STD control programmes with family planning initiatives.},

Drawing on the gonorrhea model of Lajmanovich and Yorke, a multigroup model that embraces both resistant and sensitive strains of the organism is introduced. It is shown that, like the Lajmanovich and Yorke (single-strain) model, in the general case the sensitive-resistant model has a unique globally asymptotic equilibrium. As a function of the interplay between contact rates, cure rates, and reversion rates, the equilibrium can lead to endemic infection with sensitive infection only, resistant infection only, or both, or to elimination of sensitive and resistant infection.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that strain-specific immunity occurs after gonococcal infection in a longitudinal study of 227 prostitutes resident in one small community who experienced frequent gonococcal infections. Women were examined and cultured for Neisseria gonorrhoeae at 2-wk intervals. Gonococcal isolates were typed according to protein 1 serovar, auxotype, and beta-lactamase plasmid type, and classified as to serovar and strain. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the predictions of the hypothesis with the observations of the study. Over the 14-mo period of the study, major changes in the prevalence of specific serovars were observed in the gonococcal population infecting these women. Women with HIV infection experienced a higher rate of gonococcal infection (0.56 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.04, P less than 0.05, t test) compared with HIV-negative women and were more likely to experience multiple infections with the same strain. The duration of prostitution was inversely related to the frequency of gonococcal infection. Women experiencing an infection with a specific gonococcal serovar were at a 2- to 10-fold reduced risk of reinfection with the same serovar, except for the 1B-1 serovar. The results of the study were consistent with all four predictions of the hypothesis. Infection with a specific gonococcal serovar results in specific but incomplete protection against subsequent infection with the homologous serovar. The mechanism of this protection remains to be determined.},

@article{Potterat1987,
abstract = {In Colorado Springs, Colorado, between January and June 1981, approximately 400 cases of gonorrhea in heterosexual men generated approximately 200 "spread" cases in women. The ratio of spread cases to index cases (0.5) is an empiric measure of the reproductive rate for the disease, i.e., the rate at which an infected person replaces himself. Although a reproductive rate of less than one theoretically should produce extinction of the disease, the rate derived from these data is shown to be a weighted average of the rates in symptomatic men (0.31), subsymptomatic men (0.79), and asymptomatic men (1.30). Approximately 35{\%} of gonorrhea transmitted by men may be attributed to the asymptomatic group, which constitutes 10-15{\%} of the infected population. If the observations in this community are applied to the nation as a whole, we estimate that approximately 1.7 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 1981, as compared with the 990,864 cases actually occurred in 1981, as compared with the 990,864 cases actually reported. This estimate is close to those usually quoted but differs in gender composition. Whereas the observed male-to-female ratio is 1.48:1, the predicted ratio, based on estimates of reproductive rates in subgroups, is 0.8. This analysis supports the theoretical notion that the endemicity of gonorrhea is maintained by heightened transmission within small groups, and it suggests that underdetection is more important than underreporting in the assessment of the "true" incidence of this infection.},

abstract = {Gonorrhea (GU) and nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), the commonest sexually transmitted diseases in men, are endemic at high levels in most regions of the world, despite effective methods of diagnosis and treatment. NGU is a milder disease with a longer incubation period and longer duration of symptoms before treatment. Although Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum appear to account for a majority of NGU cases, the cause of ∼20{\%} of cases remains unknown. NGU is about twice as common as GU in Western countries, and on the basis of national statistics from Great Britain, its incidence has been thought to be increasing more rapidly. However, data from individual clinics suggest that incidence of both diseases has remained stable over the past decade. The increased incidence of NGU in Great Britain over the past decade probably results from increased recognition or reporting. Marked socioeconomic and racial differences in both relative incidence of and susceptibility to NGU and GU have been found repeatedly but are unexplained. Men appear to transmit GU to women more efficiently than vice versa. Neisseria gonorrhoeae appears to be more infectious than C. trachomatis for both men and women, but interpretation of differences in susceptibility and transmission is hindered by ignorance of natural and acquired immunity to these agents. Of the several important time intervals in chains of transmission of venereal urethritis, only incubation periods and iatrotropic intervals for GU and NGU and the posttreatment period of infectivity for GU are known.},

The relative risk for gonorrhea in these central core areas, compared to background state rates, is 19.8 for men and 15.9 for women, but as high as 40 in selected census tracts. Prevalence appears to approach 20{\%} in some areas, the level postulated by current epidemiologic models for continuing endemic transmission. These core areas are characterized by high population density, low socioeconomic status and a male to female case ratio of one or lower. Contact investigation data suggest that sexual contact tends to exhibit geographic clustering as well. These observations provide support for narrow focusing of epidemiologic resources as a major disease control strategy.},

However, in the presence of both self- and cross-dispersal, the equilibrium state can still remain nonlinearly asymptotically stable in the entire feasible region provided a certain condition involving self- and cross-dispersal coefficients is satisfied. It is also seen in this case that, for the linearly stable equilibrium state, there exists a subregion of the feasible region where it is nonlinearly asymptotically stable.},

Recent studies have shown that most men and woen who are infected with N. gonorrhoeae develop symptoms as a result of that infection. These same studies have shown that a minority of patients develop asymptomatic gonococcal infection. Since asymptomatically infected men and women are less likely to seek treatment, they have a much longer duration of infection than do their symptomatic counterparts. Asymptomatically infected men and women thus accumulate, so that at any given time most of the men and women in the population who are infected with N. gonorrhoeae have no symptoms.},

abstract = {The continually rising trend in the incidence of venereal diseases, especially gonorrhoea, in a large number of countries, both developed and developing is causing considerable public health concern. There is a disquieting volume of human suffering involved, as well as large economic losses in treatment and hospitalization. The present paper reviews the existing state of development in the mathematical modelling of the relevant disease dynamics. The ‘criss-cross' nature of the infections, which in heterosexual contacts switch between the male and female populations, together with the nonlinear form of the rate of spread normally occurring in infectious diseases, leads to special types of simultaneous nonlinear differential equations. The simplest deterministic models available entail threshold phenomena connecting the maintenance of endemic states to the contact-rates, the personto-person infection-rates, and the removal-rates. A few stochastic results are also available. Special attention is given to the aspects of nonhomogeneous mixing, analysis of contact-rates, infection without immunity, allowance for asymptomatic infection, the recognition of many different classes of infected individuals, and the problems of public health forecasting and control. In some cases transient solutions of the equations can be used to forecast future trends in disease incidence, depending on appropriate assumptions about alternative public health interventions. It is concluded that further mathematical work should be concentrated on relatively simple models comprising no more than three or four district epidemiological groups for each sex. There should be both (i) more intense mathematical investigations, and (ii) new attempts to assimilate the models directly to public health venereal disease control.},

Minocycline prophylaxis completely prevented infection by gonococci susceptible to 0.75 microgram or less of tetracycline per milliliter, reduced the risk of infection or prolonged the incubation period in men exposed to gonococci susceptible to 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms per milliliter, but did not prevent infection or prolong incubation in men exposed to gonococci resistant to 2.0 micrograms.

abstract = {The medical records of 278 women infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae during a 6-month period were reviewed. These represented 75{\%} of the infections in women at Boston City Hospital during this time. Women who presented to the venereal-disease clinic because they had had contact with an infected man and women who were found to be infected during routine examinations in the obstetrics-and-gynaecology clinic were usually free of symptoms or had non-specific symptoms such as vaginal discharge. However, these women accounted for only 108 (39{\%}) of the 278 infections. Most of the infections were in women who presented to the emergency-care areas of the hospital with symptomatic gonococcal infections. At least 86 (31{\%}) of the 278 infections were in women who had pelvic inflammatory disease. These data indicate that the clinical spectrum of gonococcal infection varies according to where the patients are seen and that the widely held concept that most gonococcal infections in women are asymptomatic may be erroneous.},

abstract = {During 1972 a total of 2,090 men and 1,489 women were seen in the VD clinic in Uppsala, Sweden. The most frequent diagnosis among the men was non-gonococcal urethritis (38 per cent.) and among the women non-gonococcal vaginitis (34 per cent.), N. gonorrhoeae was found in 22 per cent. of the men and in 33 per cent. of the women, 68 per cent. of the men with gonorrhoea attended because of symptoms, but 67 per cent. of the men without gonococcal infections came for the same reason. 39 per cent. of the women with gonorrhoea attended after being told by their sexual partner; it was found that women coming because of symptoms were most likely to have non-gonococcal infection. Gonorrhoea without subjective symptoms was found in 23 per cent. of the men and 50 per cent. of the women. Gonorrhoea was found in association with scabies in 9 out of 18 men and in 3 out of 5 women. A rising incidence of pharyngeal gonococcal infections has been noticed at the clinic and the figures for 1972 were 6 per cent. of the men and 9 per cnet. of the women with gonorrhoea. The route of infection was usually oro-genital contact, but in some cases other routes had to be considered. It was not possible to define a promiscuous group of patients suitable for a planned study of prophylactic treatment, as only 2 per cent. of the men and 1 per cent. of the women had had nore than one gonococcal infection during the preceding year. The standard treatment for genital gonorrhoea (ampicillin 2 times 1 g. orally with a 5-hour interval) was very satisfactory and gave a 98 per cent. cure rate. This was possible because there were few gonococcal strains with decreased panicillin sensitivity. There were considerable problems in treating the pharyngeal infections, the standard treatment failing in 61 per cent.},

@misc{Lee1972,
abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic statistical model to evaluate the potential impact on the incidence of gonorrhea of a prophylactic intravaginal compound. The model predicts the change in the national incidence of gonorrhea in the US at various hypothetical levels of effectiveness of the topical prophylactic and of population usage. Factors analyzed in calculating the expected number of cases of gonorrhea under different conditions included the average risk of an uninfected person acquiring gonorrhea during a generation (incubation + average time to next sex act), the overall rate of loss of infectiousness whether by treatment or spontaneous cure during a generation, the proportion of at risk individuals prevented from acquiring a gonococcal infection in a generation by a prophylactic compound, and the proportion of the population at risk using the compound before each act of coitus. This model indicates that, with no changes in venereal disease prevention and treatment programs, the number of cases of gonorrhea will increase by 17{\%} from 577,486 in 1970 to 674,804 in 1971. However, if only 30{\%} of the population at risk used a prophylactic product that is 70{\%} effective, gonorrhea could be almost completely eliminated within 5 years. Even a 50{\%} effective prohylactic used by only 25{\%} of the at risk population could produce dramatic decreases in the incidence of gonorrhea in a short time. Prophylactic programs will be most effective if incorporated into existing treatment and education programs.},
