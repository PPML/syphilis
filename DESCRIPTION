Description: This package contains an ordinary differential equations model of
		syphilis fit to syphilis case data from Louisiana and Massachusetts and its
		analysis investigating hypothetical screening and treatment scenarios. The
		model is fit using a Bayesian approach relying on the Markov Chain Monte
		Carlo method to sample the defined posterior distribution.
